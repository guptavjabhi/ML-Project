  It's a pleasant evening, we just visit to have dinner, but we really feel like a special guest by Pritam, good service, good food, good environment, open space view and fresh air, as we enter in to the restaurant we interacted with Pritam, he suggested us the best dishes, Thai murgh tikka was the best, and Begum mocktail which was made by Prathamesh was so good that I will put my favourite drink list, I would love to visit again to have this kind of service.

  Recently held our recruitment drive here - Ryan &amp; Sachin the banquet managers helped give us the best deal and the service was amazing. Shubham was the star and never saw the smile disappear from his face. We did have an issues with the lunch but the breakfast and sunday buffet covered up for it.  The boardrooms were clean, well maintained, perfect service for tea coffee, guests were attended well.  Thank you so much for making our weekend drive easy to work upon.

  Had been to Mostly Grills,Orchids rooftop restaurant. It has a lovely ambience. We were lucky as there was kebab festival going on. The ambience, live music, and the whole setup for the festival was appealing.  The courteous,warm and polite staff made us comfortable and looked after us like a perfect host the whole evening. The food was excellent and was served with a smile and love by the staff. We had a perfect wonderful evening out with the family and will definitely visit again.

The hotel is also very close to the airport which is very efficient for travellers who are commuting by flight.

  Front desk staff is very helpful. I had booked 2 rooms through Mr.Noel for my family who was recently under quarantine for a week as per Maharashtra State Government rules. Mr. Noel is always accessible for all airlines. Great amenities and facilities offered by the hotel. Restaurant has a good ambience and serve excellent food. The hotel has close proximity to both International and domestic airports and located in downtown area. We at Iran Air highly recommend Hotel Orchid to our passengers and also family and friends. Mr. Noel is always there to provide excellent services. Bravo! The services of Gauri Neelam at Front Desk and Shorn Bell desk were outstanding.  - Shahbaaz from Iran Air

  Had a great stay at The Orchid hotel Ville Parle Mumbai recently. Connected to Executive Chef  Navid Akhtar to get non spicy, oil less food suitable for my palate. I was attended to by Chef Rishikesh Kasare, with the magic touch. He planned the menu according to my needs and churned our delicious salads, sauteed veggies, pasta, curd rice as per my taste. The stay was lovely and I did not have to worry about “hotel food” and did not miss my home cooked food. Thanks Chef Rishikesh. Hope to have more delicacies cooked by you on my next visit. Special thanks to Executive Chef  Navid Akhtar for the wonderful care during my stay.

The hotel staff is really helpful an courteous. they truly understand the meaning of hospitality. I could see that the hotel was really busy as they were full on that day , but i remember the name of a staff Bharat who really helped us in the room when ever we needed any thing. Very prompt and polite staff. The food is just amazing . we did not opt for the gala dinner and stayed in the room and ordered from room service. the food portion was apt and the service was also fast. we had a lovely morning breakfast . It was a lovely spread. in all a total value

As I am a fitness freak, I visited their gymnasium and honestly I felt it was small for the hotel of this size but it was nicely maintained. Rajesh was very courteous and shared few tips with me for stretching and that was very helpful. The front desk team was courteous and they extended an early check in our day of arrival and also late checkout on our special request as we were awake till late on 31st.

They really controlled the guest very well and we had our room in 30 minutes. The room was clean and well maintained. We also has taken the gala dinner at the roof top , it was a lovely evening setup done by the hotel. Great experience sitting up . Lovely music and wonderful buffet. It was in all a lovely evening that got over by 11 pm due to government norms but we thoroughly enjoyed it.

The thali is irresistible. The staff and their hospitality is 5 star. I had a warm welcome by staff Suparna,  Minal, Rahul,  Mahesh , Abhijeet and the entire staff. Hats off to that entire staff. Words are not enough to explain the hospitality,  a visit to the hotel is a must to experience it all.

  We had a three day wedding function at the Orchid hotel and I must say that the service was really very nice. Our stay as well as our ceremonies were hospitable. The food was excellent especially the Manchow soup. My nephew who doesn’t drink soups also drank it. The preparation of Chef Rishikesh and Chef Sufiyan has been phenomenal. Roshan Lobo, Ryan, Mr. Aniket Gawde and Mr. Adish have also been very helpful, always on the toes to assist us, hospitable, warm and welcoming. Overall, i was highly satisfied with the food, service and the quality of my stay and would highly urge anyone to consider keeping their function there. Special thanks to Mr. Roshan Lobo and his entire team for making this a success.

  Orchid, what to say about this property. This is so close to me and my wife as it was our wedding venue. Each and everytime we go there, its a nostalgic feeling for us. Mostly Grills- Their rooftop restaurtent is our 1st choice of restaurtent everytime we plan to dine out. Cool evening breeze overlooking the airport runway and their scrumptious meal will make your evening perfect. Jayni and Pritam made our time a memorable one with their warm hospitality and their efforts to look after the guest with such a minute details makes it even more worthy. We are so glad and confident that everytime when we will come here, these guys are there to take care of everything.

  Building is very good , Location is very good . the rating i have given for that only !  apart from this , Nothing is good about this hotel !  at the time of check in , the person was seating at reception was looked like frustrated , he told us only the things which are not allowed ! after that we have asked him about the Gym timing he said 9 AM to 6 PM ... Breakfast timing after 8 we can order and it will take 40 minutes to serve in room !  the worst thing ... we have on the room cleaning sign on the door at the time we left for the office in the morning , but when we reach hotel around 7:30 PM , the room was as it is like we left in the morning ... it took 40 minutes to clean and we had to wait out side   the gentlemen who welcome us at the time of check in at reception had

  Had a great time last night. The food was great, ambience was nice and service was superb. The music was surprising (person playing old Hindi songs on Veena) but was great. The menu was limited but there was something from all their restaurants ( so yes there was south India ln offcourse, but also Indian and continental). We had some beer, some veg and non veg starters and veg south Indian main course. The entire restaurant staff and waiters were very helpful and service was quick. There were also only 3-4 tables with other guests so that helped. While overall we were very happy, the veg south Indian options could have been more - they had only 2 main course options, but they were delicious! Overall, it was great to step out after s long lockdown and have some great food.

  We had to come for a medical check in Mumbai  and had to stay close to the domestic airport. My wife had come to Mumbai few years back and she had stayed at the orchid and had a pleasant stay , so we decided to stay here itself. As we entered the hotel we were not very happy as we found the lobby empty and the air conditioning was off. But sooner we realised why. We stayed in there club room facing the airport. The rooms are very neat and very spacious. I must stay the staff of the orchid is just exceptional. They really take care of your needs and your requirements. I was extremely happy with the food though it was fixed meal in trays delivered to our room. We stayed for two days but enjoyed ourselves well. Congrats the orchid and all the best

Awesome food , good variety and very tasty. The best was how these boys took care of all the social distancing and served us . The restaurant had many customers and I could see all were attended very well. I am sure when all goes fine I will surely come back again here

  I was traveling with my family from dubai and had to quarentine in mumbai for three days . My friends had suggested me Orchid to stay in. I am new to Mumbai and I must say I made the right decision. As I was with my small daughter I was quiet scared in choosing a hotel to stay in such circumstances. I was quiet amazed to see how clean and hygienic the hotel lobby was when I entered. Yes it was not light well which i can understand. But the staff was very polite and asked us about our journey which was very touching. The rooms are spacious and clean. The Lenin was up to mark and the boys who attended us were very polite and concerned. The food was fixed trays but quiet good in taste .  In all I had a wonderful stay with my family. Highly recommended.

  This is my umpteenth visit to The Orchid Hotel . I stayed there 2 times in June and July. Literally a stones throw from the domestic airport, The Orchid is best value for money proposition in my opinion. The hospitality is unmatched and I always feel it is a home away from home for me. The newly renovated rooms are very cozy and comfortable ( I still prefer the rooms from the main wing) , spotlessly clean. The hotel has prepared well for the Covid19 pandemic and all the precautions are taken to make you safe. Food is excellent and service full of warmth. Gauri, Deepika and Kunal at the front desk, Welesly , Harshad in Vindhya's and Chef Bala all make your stay a memorable one. Highly recommended !!

  I was at the orchid Mumbai during last 3 days of this month. Due to the lockdown  scenario the hotel has cut down their services which are otherwise well looked after. However, the hotel staff do their best to make their guests as comfortable as possible. A special mention about a boy in the housekeeping department named Yogesh Bodke whose care and concern really touched my heart, it took great care of my requirements keeping in mind my age and physical needs. In short, I can honestly declare - The Orchid Stands HIGH for its hospitality in the Hotel Industry. South of vindhayas the only restaurant open as of now serves excellent food and Good service as well.

  I did a part of my quarantine at this property in a suite on the 5th floor overlooking the airport. From 22nd June to 27th June. The check-in was quick and the room was very spacious.  I did not expect so much space in a Mumbai hotel so I was pleasantly surprised. The alleyways were dimly lit which I fail to understand why but once inside the suite things were different. Good quality furniture, quite classy interior. The room was quite, bed was great. The view made the otherwise boring quarantine bearable as I could see flights landing and taking off all the time. Special mention for the Executive chef Navid who went above and beyond. Meals were always great. He was happy to send Kadha, turmeric tea, fruits or even adrak shahad in these extraordinary times.

  The breakfast was good: hash browns that really were hash browns rather than a local interpretation; a vegetable omelette done properly…  The interior has visual appeal. It isn’t just the lobby but also the well between floors.  A free newspaper in the morning is also a nice touch.  But… A small beer, two small bowls of curry from the buffet, each no bigger than a lady’s fist, and a bowl of rice the same size for £28. That is blatant robbery and they had no other eatery available.  The roof-top bar was not serving and all photographs from there are banned, which seems crazy when its right next to an airport and there were parakeets in a nearby tree.   Room service is unusually slow.  I was moved from my original room to another wing because of Covid-19.  When I complained,

The staff was exceptional with their hospitality - Rohit, Nadeem and Himanshu at the Front Desk were courteous at all times and made ensured a warm welcome always. The rooms may appear to be rustic and certain rooms appear to not have the best of a view - but that is mainly due to the location of the hotel among its adjoining premises. We also had lunch at the South of Vindhyas and the experience was exhilarating !! In all, it was a nostalgic feeling to come back and revisit the Orchid hospitality.

  I recommend many of my national / international guests to stay in the orchid, Vile Parle because first of It’s close proximity to the airport and secondly cause of the helpful and friendly staff and their great customer service.  Recently one of my guests from Germany needed a late check out and without any hesitation the duty manager Mr. Rohit helped him out and ensured that he had a late check out as well as a very pleasant experience during his stay.  I will always recommend the orchid as the ideal choice of hotel for stay in Mumbai.

  Nicely located for flying from the domestic airport and only 20 minutes away from terminal two, this ageing but elegant hotel is reasonably priced for five star accommodation.  The rooms are adequate but not exceptional although the hotel is quite grand and beautiful.  The reasonable price for the room is eclipsed by the extortionate prices in the restaurants and bars which are again very well done especially the roof terrace with its live music and its unique decor.  The staff are very attentive and helpful and tend to make you feel special as long as you are spending money of course.  It can be a little tricky to navigate the hotel and make use of the gym, the 7th floor, the coffee shop etc but overall the experience was very good.

  I along with my colleague from Germany was on a business trip and was returning from Surat by car on 27 Feb 20. It took us about seven hours as the traffic on the last stretch was quite heavy. I reached the Orchid at about 11:30 at night after dropping my colleague at T2 just in time to catch his Mumbai-Paris Flight. The check-in was simple. The Room was quite big and well furnished. The in-room wi-fi worked very fine. Breakfast spread was simply huge. The Check-out was simple as well.  I was dropped at Mumbai T1. It was a pleasant stay.  Look forward to visit again.

  I stayed for one night and it was excellent value for money! Smith at the hotel reception upgraded my room, and it was really spacious! The  quality of the room I was given was much higher stars than the ratings suggest. The room had the usual amenities of most 5 star hotels. I had a lovely view over the runway, with a direct line of planes taking off and landing (plane spotter heaven!). The waterfall feature in the main foyer is mesmerising! For the price of the room and its location close to the airport, it certainly gives its much, much pricier luxury hotel neighbours a run for their money. It claims eco-friendly credentials although I am not too sure what that involved. It certainly looked and felt like a good-quality hotel. Would highly recommend if you want 5 star comfort

  At arrival the staff was friendly and accommodating, no waiting times throughout my stay but the amenities were not up to western 5-star standards.   That being said especially Mr. Shailesh during dinner hours was a delight and at my service, frequently checking in via eye contact and picking up on my queue immediately.   For other staff members, my orders had gotten lost repeatedly. At some point I had to ask 3 times for a can of coke until the order arrived some 10 minutes later.   I requested a late check-out and wasn’t charged, and Mr Smith made my transfer to the airport a breeze! Thank you!   Last note: the old gym equipment left marks on my hands that I could barely wash off. Please update!

It was hortible experience. Additionally when i report to Manager he saud to noise we dont allow. What the hell. They dont know to say sorry. I complained written but until mow no reply.  2. The receptionist doesnt read the customer request. They are really helpless no use kind if service.  3.

  South of Vindhyas specializes in serving South Indian cuisine. They have a variety of sit-down buffet options which include veg buffet, sea-food buffet or combination buffet of seafood, chicken &amp; mutton!  Also you can enjoy a live ghazal night while relishing the lip-smacking food.  I tried the combination buffet served here which included 3 types of appetizers, mocktail, thali with all the main course gravies, rice and appams/phulkas/malabari paratha.  Appetizers: Rawa Fish Fry: Fish is deep fried in rawa making it crispy from outside and soft and flavoursome from inside. This is my favourite appetizer from their menu  Pepper chicken: Small pieces of chicken are tossed with onion, tomatoes and south indian spices. This is a semi dry appetizer.  Prawns fry: Medium-sized prawns

It is known for its nawabi tradition,as the decor is done as per the tradition and the center of attraction is it has its own pool at the roof top of the restaurant. They have arranged table beside the pool. They have live music going on is a traditional way it give different vibes to the food.They have put nawab style seating arrangement .It has a small fountain inside and comfortable seating arrangement.The food was amazing and the service was top notch.

  Seek alternatives. This hotel is located close to the airport but far from anything else. The rooms are dated and the bathrooms are not clean as you would expect. The hotel does not allow outside guests even during day time. Food and beverage options at this hotel is limited and expensive in comparison to other options available. Would not recommend.

  Before I come to my disappointed, let me first share a few good things about this property. Orchid was considered to be one of the prime properties 10 years ago. Still, the location is great, especially if you are on a quick business trip and looking for an accomodation around the airport.  The food is as expensive as Marriott, however the quality has degraded almost in the similar fashion as its other ammenities.  Now coming to two major disappointment -  1. Quality of bed linens are poor to say the least. You cannot charge a person ₹30000 and give him smelly, teared bed linens with no option to opt for a thinner pillow. The towels in the bathroom were as bad as available in Indian Railway.  2. Me along with a colleague of mine checked in at 8.00 pm. We were extremely tired but

  So I happened to visit the South of Vindhyas at The Orchid and must say I had a lovely time. I feasted at the Sea-Feast . They had a huge spread and great variety. The whole ambience was turned into koli style and they even had live performance-koli dance. So coming to what we had: *SOUP* Prawn rasam- the traditional spicy taste, with the crunch of prawns *APPETIZERS* 1. Prawns dry masala- this was excellent, cooked well. 2. Fish fry- fish used was river sole, so soft, mouth-melting 3. Chicken pepper- Andhra style, spicy and masaledaar *MAINS* *Breads* Appam Malabari paratha Kal roti *Rice* Tomato rice- tomato flavoured spicy rice The fish thali had a variety of dishes from veg stew, chicken curry, mutton curry, fish curry, prawns curry, crab curry, and squid.

  Just visited South Of Vindhyas  at The Orchid and they had a seafood festival going on. Let me begin by saying such a wonderful ambience created. The staff was dressed in traditional koli clothes and they had boats nets and various fishes as decoration. I felt like I was literally sitting in the koliwada being served fresh fish from the ocean.  While there, Dakota staff helped us in making some really good choices. Special thanks to Harshad, Vishal, Kunal, Aditya Raj and Sameer.   To begin we called for some delicious starters. Since it was the seafood festival we decided to call for non vegetarian starters. We ordered:  Fried fish: Delicious rava fried boneless fish that was served piping hot along with onion lime and a lovely green chilli. The fish was superbly fresh. Enjoyed

  South of Vindhyas is a fine dining located at The Orchid hotel in Vile Parle east. The restaraunt is at the ground floor of the hotel and has a very welcoming vibe and ambience. Their specialty is mainly in dishes from Andhra, Kerela and South.  They recently have started their seafood festival where in they are serving the very best of different flavours of Coast and South. The interiors are well decorated as the theme of the seafood festival and they also have a live appam kitchen. Also as a part of the theme, at the end of the day there is a small koli performance done by the staff which added more charm to the entire seafood festival theme experience.   As we entered we were welcomed by the staff and Mr.Vishal, our host for the evening, took care of everything really well.

  We stayed at the Orchid on our last night in India. We chose it for its location bear Mumbai airport.   The hotel was clean and tidy and of a high standard, although was not well appointed in terms of mini bar and amenities (complimentary food and beverages; as well as mini bar) in the room itself - maybe this is the norm in India. That said the monsoon shower was amazing - I could have spent an hour in there!  The bed was also fantastic.  It is a 5star hotel and it prides itself on being eco-friendly.  There are a number of restaurants within - we only dined at one (Boulevard’s - which is the basic a la carte restaurant for dinner and breakfast). The roof top bar looked great but we were travelling with older parents and a 15 month old - more suited to a younger demographic.

I requested for towels 3 times, one of which was escalation to Guest Relation Execs, but to no action. I finally had to walk up to a attendant who had towels in hand to grab one for my room. Any Room service is also dead slow. Control in room is little outdated technology.   Reception area/Lobby is way too crowded for no reason. It looks very compact unlike in pictures. During my visit there were may be one or two guest in Lobby but it was jam packed with employees. Highlight is the Breakfast in South of Vindhyas restaurant.

  I have stayed in the hotel earlier and was loath to stay in it recently. But I did for two reasons. First it is close to the airport.  Second I got a very good rate. Pros: the location is nice. The cons are that it always seems a little crowded. When I arrived there were no rooms available but then their Assistant Manager customer service Urvashi appeared and asked us to wait till we got our rooms. She also got me a free upgrade. It is a standard close to the airport business hotel but one friendly service made all the difference. To make the experience consistently good better trained front office staff or a free drop off to both Mumbai terminals would be good.

  Stayed at Orchid for 3 days . One plus point of this hotel is that it is very near( around 500mtr) to Mumbai  airport and hotel provides shuttle service to the airport. Reception staff was very polite and helpful especially Vikas at front desk  who upgraded our room to newer wing on our request. Try to book a room in newer wing as rooms in older wing are not good. Buffet breakfast was good and they have two different restaurants for it( one on ground floor is purely veg). Roof top restaurant ( with runway view) is   Ok. Overall had a nice experience.

They go out of the way to make us feel happy n relaxed. Be it the reception at the time of check-in. The warmth and the attention to detaiing was awesome. They even told us about the South of vindiyas breakfast . Also told us about the hotel being Non smoking hotel. I am impressed. We had a great time at the pool side . Lovely weather and calmness. The evening was lovely with the pianist playing in the lobby. Lovely soothing music. Incall we had a great time in our one day stay. It was a worth money spend and I would like to wish them all the very best for the new year. This hotel

  Upon checking into the Orchid, I realized that my laptop computer had been left at the security check at the Kochi airport.  I was beside myself with worry.  I went to the lobby and was met by one of my friends at the luggage desk.  He immediately sent me to Mr. Noel D'lima.  He repeatedly assured me that my computer would be found and not to worry.  True to his word, it was located and Mr. D'lima went out of his way to meet the delivery at the Mumbai domestic airport and escort me to my international flight.  He would not leave my side until I was through security and that I still had my computer.  He and the staff at the Orchid cannot be complemented more.  With Mr. D'lima's dedication, I was saved from financial loss and my mind was at rest.  Thank you again.  Carlan Wilson

The perfect warm welcome every guest would dream of.   It's the smallest thing to do, which makes a huge difference. I had a tiring day because of a long flight. I was expecting a regular formalities at the Front Desk. Bht then i was guided to the Duty Manager desk. And the whole experience turns in to a ""WOW""! The kind of humility this person showed me by just asking how was my day? Its a small thing to ask. But i just realized ""its not what you say..but how you say it!""...And precisely this gentleman did it. I couldn't stop asking his name.  Not only he made me feel home, but showed me that he is the best person you should meet once

  Visited mostly grills on good evening for dinner, and had a great time here. I ordered orange basil martini and graple Mocktails and bhatti da murgh, bharwan khumbh, laal mirch ka paneer tikka, veg biryani for dinner along with rasmalai as a dessert. The mocktails made for a good side drink to have and the tikka and bhatti da murg was a very good starter to have it had a perfect mix of spicyness and tenderness for a starter.The biryani was simply good and had the right ingredients for a good biryani and was made very well just like everything that i ordered Rasmali was a icing on top and made the dinner complete. Had a good time here and will recommend for a decent nice outing.

We met Mr. Anshul in the lobby who proactively asked for any assistance as he saw us standing in the lobby and we shared our difficulty in booking a cab, he introduced us to Mr. Wesley who went ahead and assisted us with booking a large taxi and all 5 of us could travel with our luggage in the same. It was an act of proactive approach that made us feel so special. Will certainly come back to stay with you all in our next stay.

Recently visited South of Vindhyas which is located on the ground floor of The Orchid Hotel close to the domestic airport.   This place is truly heaven for all the south Indian food lovers.!!  As soon as you enter this place you would be greeted warmly with the staff wearing south Indian attire.  The ambience here is beautiful giving it a very classic and traditional feel.   Live singing with orchestra keeps playing which definitely makes you feel calm and happy.   So before we could start our meals we were helped with water and a bowl to wash our hands .

  The first two nights we were stuck in small room (which was apparently meant for 3 adults) with a bathroom that smelt of cigarettes and a bathtub that would not drain water. After numerous complaints they finally moved us to a much larger room (definitely big enough for 3) with a bathroom which had a shower, bathtub that smelt much better.   I think your experience of the hotel really depends on the staff that you come across during your stay.   The duty manager on 4th floor Kanaiyah was so friendly and pleasant - he went above and beyond to help us.   The staff in Vindhyas last night were all lovely.

To begin with, the welcome desk at this hotel is an classic example of how people in hospitality industry should not be. The girl at the welcome desk/check-in was totally customer-unfriendly, insensitive and indifferent to the guest. Either she has had a bad day or the hotel’s general attitude towards the guest was being reflected by her manner of speech.   Simplest of requests like availability of rooms with refrigerator was met with a curt response rather than an Yes or No. I don’t understand where has all the soft skills and ipr skills have disappeared from Orchid.

  A visit to South of Vindhyas is highly recommended by me to all the people who love food which is staple in the southern Indian households. The ambience itself makes one feel the tradition and culture of south. The heavy wooden art work, chairs, tables made from carved wood And more over the music which clicks all the correct buttons to make one feel completely relaxed. The food is not too spicy and not too mild either. It has use of coconut, tamarind, curry leaves, lentils, dry spices and of courses lots of sea food. There is an a la carte option along with fixed thalis too. We chose both and relished both equally. There were lovely appetisers like the dal Vada and the paniyaram which were crispy outside and soft within. The chutneys were so perfect. They had a variety of that

They have a roof top diner, a buffet place and an authentic South Indian restaurant called south of Vindhyas which is my favourite. Have been to this restaurant several times for lunch and dinner as they serve some lip smacking food. It’s been a favourite with the guests we have from abroad too.

  We chose the hotel because it was so close to the airporta d that was the best part.  We also chose it also because it was the first Ecotel, we had read about. The hotel had an underlying odor everywhere along the corridors. The rooftop restaurant was such a disappointment and gad a fake Goa look in Mumbai. The maitre de came to our table because we were so unhappy but the replacement was no better. Waste of money

  Stayed at The Orchid Mumbai for a day by chance as our flight got cancelled and the airlines put up here.   But, it was a blessing in disguise as it allowed me to discover this excellent Transit Hotel.   The location is very convenient as it is just a few minutes away from both, domestic and international terminals.   The rooms are very beautiful and spacious. Very modern and comfortable. The bathroom is huge and clean.   The food was very delicious.   The best part of the hotel is their service. Very polite and well-mannered staff. Took care of every little need of ours.   I will definitely stay here again whenever I visit Mumbai.

  This must be nth visit to Orchid as reaching Mumbai domestic airport in night and had next Morning flight from same terminal so orchid is most convenient. They offer complimentary pick up and drop to this terminal but it's very difficult to get pick up as it's too complicated to reach them for booking. Called on land line someone talked then transferred to concerned person who is not able to hear. He gives a mobile that is equally difficult to reach. When reached at airport there was no representative so has to arrange on own. Hotel staff everything same familar satisfying so another pleasant experience. One new experience utilised swimming pool facility on roof top that was quite satisfying.

  Another visit to Mumbai and not to say wanted to stay at the Orchid again . A festive season and I was full of suprises during my stay. Lovely decoration of Rangoli . The hotel lobby was very well decorated . A new element this time was the Piano . Lovely music in the lobby. My kids as always loved the South of Vindiyas. I missed to see chef Bala this time . But I met Mr.Sahani this time . What a charmer he is . He told me about the hotel and goa and has advised me to go there with my wife . Next visit is Goa for sure . I have always loved the hospitality of the Orchid . God bless you guys.

  The rating i have provided is based on a comparative experience with the other starred hotels i have stayed with.  Orchid is pretty close to the domestic and international airports. I have stayed there for 3 days. Here are the things that weren't up to the standard.  Long check-in time: It almost took them close to 20 mins to check me in on a confirmed reservation. Wifi : Their complimentary wifi policy (max of 2 devices and 1Mbps) is as bad as it gets. I faced frequent dropped connections/ and interruptions while doing normal video conferencing. One would expect a 5-star hotel to provide decent wifi service and this is ridiculous. No outside food policy: This is the first time i have seen something like this. They do mention that they have all the cuisines available in-house

  The hotel does its best to be eco friendly and does a great job and I suggest to go a little further such as eliminate plastic (specifically water bottles), use non toxic air fresheners (the ones used are super chemical) and deal with the mold in the rooms. The pool on the top floor is a decent size but there are no loungers to use. Great vegetarian restaurant on the ground floor! Loved it. The staff was mostly friendly although when I’d been out for a morning walk, I was almost rugby tackled by a jobsworthy hostess. The doorman with the impressive hat was most welcoming. Very close to the airport.

  Stayed here 4 times. Great Location, excellent check in.Thank you Gauri!! Boulevard good as usual. Everything much the same roof top restaurant nice too. Not a  habitual complainer but for God's sake stop over promoting the South of Vindiyas  restaurant. Calling the room and waking us up from sleep in the afternoon and evening with promo offers,.. pushing us persistently for veg breakfast to ground floor when entering Boulevard...This promotion is overkill and stretching it too far for decency. Not that the restaurant is so great it's pretty expensive a fish curry one rice one roti was 1790.... Cheaper to eat at boulevard. Please don't do this, this is crossing the line in hospitality for an otherwise great hotel I stay annually.

  In life you pay for quality. If you want cheap then find a lodgings or hostel. But if you can afford the price, The Orchid provides exactly what you would expect for the cost. It is a tip top quality establishment with very comfortable and well maintained rooms. The staff are appropriately very polite, considerate and attentive. I was having to spend an overnight in Mumbai before departing back to the UK after a two month monsoon visit to India. My choice of one day of comfortable surroundings, close to the airport, was certainly fulfilled.

  Every review should ideally start with Pros, but this hotel has more cons to offer than Pros (Hardly Any).  1.The first thing that one notices about this property is its location. It is in a secluded spot nearby to a residential cum commercial area.  2.The courteous behavior is simply to fool you that you are being valued. The reality is far painful. They are only good at conning you out of your pockets by exorbitantly overpriced services. 3.The other aspect that is noticeable is that this hotel has exorbitant food prices which is higher by up to 30% than other 5 star hotel chains like Holiday Inn, Raddison etc. Come to think of it that you are staying in the hotel and you will have to pay extra money for getting your food parceled.  4.The guests are in a no man's land if they

No attempt has been made to modernise the Indian classics and that is what sets it apart.  Started of with some Violent Voilet and fresh fruits. Violent Voilet was perfect and refreshing and the fruits were fresh.  In Appetizer we had: Veg Platter and Non Veg

  So I love Sunday brunches and was more than happy when I got the chance to visit Boulevard on the first floor of The Orchid Hotel just beside the domestic airport.  So it's a five star hotel and the ambiance is as sucj, very lavish and royal, so the complete first floor is theirs with a very water drop at the centre, which makes the ambiance absolutely stunning!  'Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or maybe brunch, tea, or midnight snack it doesn't matter. Any time any day just walk into our exclusive cafe in Mumbai for a feast or a bite.' A line straight from their website. It's a coffee shop that's open 24x7 to serve you amazing food.  So the sunday brunch buffet was seriously one of the best we've visited so far. It was absolutely massive, with so many things to eat, I was confused

Although we had a fight the next day and we couldn't make use of all the facilities as we had to check out early but whatever our stay period was, it was amazing.  The only thing that was a slight disappointing was that we couldn't get the continental breakfast as there was a lot of wait time. May be it was because of shortage of space. However, we went to Vindhyas for breakfast and that was also a satisfying experience.  Overall the experience was superb!!

The icing on the cake was the morning breakfast in South of vindiyas . I have never had a better breakfast than this ever.  Me and my wife enjoyed our stay at The Orchid Mumbai . I would definitely recommend it to all my friends

  This used to be my favourite hotel. But now the issues i faced are: 1. Poor inroom dining service 2. Negligence - a high risk matter (see photo) where teres a slippery slope at the bathroom entrance, where i slipped and had a fall. Fortunately did not break my bones 3. Thick , hard pillows - despite earlier comments not improved 4. Sleepy, forgetful staff at south indian food restaurant  Management have to take negligence seriously as it can injure guests!

  We have just returned from an 8 night stay at The Orchid and just had to leave a review.  We had the most amazing time at this fantastic hotel. Whilst we haven’t travelled the world We have stayed in many hotels both in Europe and the UK and can honestly say we have never been looked after with the high level of care, service and attention to detail like we had here.  I was booked in for some dental treatment while visiting Mumbai and wanted a hotel that would ensure I would have cleanliness and comfort should I be feeling sore after my treatment and this hotel ticked all the boxes and also had a pool on the rooftop.  I was not however expecting the amazing love and care we were given by all the staff. We tried all the bars and restaurants during our stay but it was the rooftop

  While I have been staying at The Orchid on business trips, this stay has been special. I chose The Orchid for a 6 night stay with family, when we relocated from Delhi NCR to Mumbai. The reason was of course my experience in the past, but a few staff members helped make our family stay much better than expected.  The Orchid is known for its spacious rooms and great food, especially the buffet at The Boulevard (24-hours Coffee Shop) and ""India's Best Vegetarian Breakfast"" at South of Vindhyas. While my wife loved the spacious inter-connected rooms, my kids loved the buffet at The Boulevard and the Oh So Cute platter at South of Vindhyas.  What stood out though, was the contribution of some excellent staff members. I would like to make special mention of Mr. Kanhaiya Sen, who took

Hotel is very clean &amp; staff are very friendly. Food at South of Vindhyas is excellent. The coffee shop Boulevard on first floor is superb and the breakfast spread they give is great. Food is very tasty too, especially the small masala dosas they make to order for breakfast. Strawberry &amp; mango milk shakes for breakfast is too good. The roof top bar &amp; swimming pool are good, but the bar is pretty expensive I should say, but off course quality of stuff &amp; service is excellent.

  One of the main USP of this hotel is the close proximity to the domestic airport of Mumbai. Tucked in amongst various buildings, it’s a little difficult approach, like a jigsaw puzzle! My check in took about 40 minutes, because there was some communication gap between the sales desk and the front office. Once checked in, found the rooms to be rather small and in urgent need of upgradation. Buffet lunch was good, but the billing process took almost 20 minutes, which was rather long! A cup of tea was highly overpriced, and one must avoid ordering any beverages in room service. Checking out was another headache when I was told that I had not cleared the laundry bills. I clarified that I had no laundry bills pending, and they took about 15 minutes to confirm the same. On the whole,

  This hotel has the best factor for its location, just 5 min. From the domestic airport, they serve yummy food and have 2 choices of restaurants of which one serves authentic south Indian food. It has roof top pool with a beautiful terrace and for those who enjoy seeing take off landings then u can spend hours out there on the terrace with a mouth watering mocktail in hand.

  Stayed at orchid from 7-10 feb 2019 for medical conference. It’s location near domestic airport and close to Western Express Highway is plus point. Enterance of the hotel is little confusing, just ahead of Parle police station. Lobby is spacious with 70-80 meters water fall. Staff is very cooperative. They have a rooftop grill bar and restaurant from where you can have a nice drink and watch all the activities of Mumbai airport. Restaurant on 1 st floor serves breakfast and also meals. As the hotel was full, I think there was chaos during breakfast . There used to be waiting period. We had to request many times for a glass of water. The management should train the staff to give good service even when they have large crowds. They also have one South Indian restaurant on ground

  Must try rooftop of the hotel, gives you complete view of the runway and the other half is more retro. Right combination with lovely live music and breeze. To top it all what is must must is mocktails made by Sunny and very prompt service of the staff. Specially Dipak i must say u are extremely energetic and proactive and can turn anyone's day.

  The Boulevard at the Orchid brings one of Mumbai’s best buffets. I highly recommend mutton biryani, chicken 65 out there as it's a hell of a task to find really good biryani in Mumbai. Service is also very prompt and courteous.  Attention to detail, perfect execution, and exceptional service is all I can say if I have to summarise this place. Subtlety is the key for this restaurant. The team has done a great job by designing the perfect buffet menu, loved every bit of it.   Modest and sophisticated with excellent ambience is what drives this place. The buffet spread was amazing right from the soups, chaat section, veg / non vegeterian starters, varieties of salads, main course spread, and yes how can I forget the desserts they had kept.   The Chef was very polite and helped us

  Room was fine.  Staff were generally friendly and attentive.  But I was double-charged for my room and getting any response to resolve was near impossible.  Initially, a hotel voucher was not accepted, so I was forced to pay by credit card at checkout.  Some effort by myself and the travel agency got the voucher to be accepted, but I am still waiting for a refund of my credit card payment four weeks later.  I feel my requests for assistance have been purposely ignored.  I have not received a single call that suggests any level of care for a customer, and certainly customer satisfaction is far from a priority.

Service &amp; hospitality was really great.  The sunday buffet lunch is always exciting with a great spread and amazing variety.  We begin with amazing range of mocktails, breads and salads. The salads also included some of our favorate like Boccini with tomato &amp; pesto. Also a great spread of cheese &amp; veg sandwiches, with some Dhokla, and dry snack. A great combination

  Have been a patron of Orchid hotel and have been loving it since years. Probably came here when they had newly opened and I have been coming here till date. Things have remained as classy and neat here as day one. The restaurants within the hotel are beautiful and we loved the beauty and concept of each restaurant. We loved the roof top place called mostly grill which has probably Mumbai’s best view. Beautiful runway view is absolutely stunning and breathtaking. The food and the service is top notch. Even the south of Vindhyas which is specialty restaurant or the Boulevard which is a buffet restaurant are simply amazing. We have attended many food festivals and get togethers here and each time we fall deeper in love with the place. A special thanks to the entire staff right from

Our buffet included a welcome drink and a soft drink. Now we sat there and settled in and they said that starters wl be served at the table. So we waited and finally we had to ask for our welcome drink. After much waiting we got it. Until that time no starters at the table. Then finally we get 2 plates of pani puri for the 20 of us spread across a huge table. Obviously it wasn't enough and could not manage to pass around. Then same thing with some sev puri. 2 plates for 20 of us. Then we got starters. Exactly just once. 3 veg starters and 2 non veg starters served in small quarter plates. Again some 2-3 plates for all of us. So we

  This is the second time we have made an overnight stay in this beautiful hotel as it is close to the airports. Unfortunately we had forgotten how anxious staff are to try and please/serve guests so to avoid constant attention and relax we spent most of the time in our room.

Room spacious and clean.  Great shower in the bathroom.  Excellent breakfast choices.  All staff smiling, friendly and helpful.  Nice roof top swimming pool with pleasant seating area around it.

Extremely convenient if you have internal flights to or from Mumbai.  The hotel lives up to its 5-star rating and the staff is very helpful and friendly. The property is not new and does show some wear. While maintenance could be improved, the housekeeping staff keeps everything very clean.  Food is good in both restaurants, but pricey and the hotel has a no external food policy which makes it more annoying. Bed is on the firm side, but not uncomfortable.  My room price was covered, but I found out the rate a d it is very reasonable. Good value for money.

  It is supposed to be a five star hotel but I will classify this more like a 4 star. They behave like a five star but the condition of the hotel is screaming renovation. Breakfast is ample. Try for rooms on the higher floor in the new wing only. The staff is very courteous and helpful. The location though great next to terminal 2, is in a small lane and obscures the entrance. That makes it difficult for the cabs guys sometimes.   If you are near the airport there are better hotels like the Lalit, Sahara, Hyatt who are in the  same price band.

  The last time I stepped in at this hotel was for dinner with my former colleagues. After a few years, I am back again to stay the night. Orchid is a nice homely place and that's it. It was about 8 pm when I checked in and the formalities completed without much problem.   Came down again for dinner at the South Indian Restaurant on the ground floor. Seems to be a popular place as the tables were mostly occupied. Had fish mapas and rotis, The fish curry was just average, probably the Chef had not travelled to Kerala ever. The Paan flavoured Kulfi (Indian Ice Cream) was a new experience.  Back to the room. The sheets were laundered but appeared worn out though it was not. The next morning, had breakfast on the 7th floor. You can see the runway of Mumbai Airport at close distance.

We  enjoyed this picnic, while sitting in the upholstered sofa. All the time we had the pool at the rooftop all for ourselves. The boys enjoyed it in the morning, in the evening and even when it was drizzling.Only negative point, there was no locker to keep your clothes ( had to give them to the boy) and the many staff watching us swim- but

  The Orchid at the Mumbai domestic airport is convenient for someone who has an early morning flight to catch, those who are transiting, and everybody who has a reason to stay close to the airport.  The place is cosy and comfortable. The rooms are spacious and clean. The wifi is ok.  The check-in was quick and so was the the checkout.  The best part is that they have a buffet that goes to early morning. So if you arrive late (like I did at half past midnight) you are assured of a great meal.  All in all, provides all that I require in a hotel.

From the moment I checked-in till the moment I check-out, I really enjoy my stay over there. Highly professional approach is visible everywhere - from rooms to restaurants, from conference rooms to washrooms. There are many choices for having foods starting from South Indian at Lobby Level to buffet breakfast &amp; lunch on level 1 to roof top special restaurant with live music. Look forward to visit again. Keep up the good show!

Really good sized, even with a reading/relax area (sofa+tea table+chair).  3) quietness. Very goid for the light sleepers.   Negatives: 1) Personell at desk. We arrived at dinner time and our check in was quite slow.  Our concierge didn't asked us if we wanted to have dinner, nor spoke about room service. Since our check out was really early we asked for the price of airport transfer: we were told it would cost 900 idr each (with Uber we spent 150 total!!). We also were aked for a card deposit amount but after my strong protest (why asking for a card deposit that would be refound after weeks when my check out is 6 hours later?!) we

  The Orchid has all the 5* basics well anchored. Enjoying high occupancies, it is now tired and needs attention. Due to unavailability of my requested non-smoking room, i was offered an upgrade to an Executive room. however it took at least 30 mins to get that sorted out. My room was sombre, and very ordinary... in fact it looked quite tired. furniture and linen both. Amenities that i used were not replenished.. on a positive note , the seafood restaurant ""south of the Vidhyas"" was excellent.

  Its hard to find an affordable hotel in Mumbai that is easy on the pocket yet offers 5 star amenities and service.  The Orchid is definitely one them.  Its very close to the domestic airport and easy to navigate your trips around the city of mumbai as the main freeway is just around its corner.  While this is not a new property and some minor wear and tear can be noticed in some of the bathrooms -- overall it is an excellently maintained hotel with a lovely airy lobby and rooftop swimming pool and  grill restaurant.   We had opted for the executive rooms and they had large comfy beds, a seating area and lots of space.  Unfortunately our rooms did not have a great view as it looked into the hotel parking but since we hardly spent time in the rooms it was not a big issue for us.

Items in the menu were not available. The replacement that was provided was around 50% pricier. The amount and taste of the food were not up to the mark considering the price. On the brighter side, the room was spacious and well-lit. The bathroom was spotless with enough amenities. The bed linen was also clean. Room charge was also on the higher side given the overall service which was slow at times. Overall not 5-star quality but surely a solid 3.5 stars.

Unaccomodating, incompetent staff at the Front desk and restaurants, bad stink in the rooms and corridors made our stay difficult everyday.Don't know how this hotel is graded as a 5 star property.Not much choice of food either and if you order a'la carte it takes ages to come. Having each and every staff say 'namaste' every time they see you is not needed, rather their staff should be helpful and see that their guests are comfortable and happy.

  its a great hotel 2 nights $340 but I would say its not a 5 star its more a tired 4 star. the pool on the roof was best for me after 4 weeks in Mumbai. the room was ok the bed comfy but the outdated central control box for lights and aircon annoying. the staff were super friendly and helpful. the doorman looks impressive. the breakfast buffet was excellent and with a great variety of food and drinks western and Indian. the only thing I didn't like and I say beware when ordering at the bar or room service you sign and in my case the dinner and bar bill was 5000 rupees that does not include the taxes. my 2 night stay cost me $500 in food ,drink and taxes more than the room price. I was naturally pissed off. I won't stay there again. pity for the staff its not their fault.

On top of that the hotel is having non customer friendly policies like no auto rickshaw is allowed to drive in a guest, no outside food is permitted for resident guests irrespective if they want to avail the most repulsive buffet offered by hotel or not.  Housekeeping doesn't cares either to provide you with a shaving kit. The fan in room continues to make horrible sounds and no one seems to care. The hotel staff refuse to put a stamp of ""paid"" on your invoice if you pay by card. The bathtub in room either don't have a stopper or the stopper wont work to hold the water.

  I Stayed at the orchid overnight as I wasn't able to make my usual booking at the Hyatt due to it being full at the time. I last stayed here in 2005 and it was pretty reasonable at the time and is very convenient for T1 which seemed logical to make a booking as I had a domestic flight the next morning. I upgraded to a club room thinking a few drinks and snacks rather than go down to the hotel restaurant. The additional charge of 5000 rupees seemed pretty high but thought it must be worth it hence the rate. Staff, were first class as they are in the vast majority of Indian hotels but behind the facade of the lower reception area it's another story. The rooms are tatty to say the least, the moment you get in the lift you know this is going to be a big let down, this is a 3 star

  I would like to first compliment on the customer service which was warm and welcoming for foreigners like. I would like to personally compliment Ms. Priya who has very pleasant and kept our stay a memorable one especially when my friend left 2 nights earlier, she took the liberty to book him a taxi on her own mobile phone.  Now I would like to comment the following which I think the management should take note seriously. First the room rates which fluctuates terribly..the weekend rates where cheaper then the weekdays..I stayed for 5 nights and for 1st 3 nights i paid 23k rupees and the last 2 nights I paid 28k rupees  Secondly are the food. The food was excellent but the prices were exorbitant, example 1 fish and 2 jumbo prawns cost me 6k rupees or USD85 which I personally felt

  5 of us had taken 2 premium rooms at the hotel for 7 days which cost us around 1.54 Lakhs plus taxes.  And we faced many issues from the staff and the staff didn't seem to provide us services as expected.   For 3 consecutive days, I wasted almost 15-20 mins for iron which was supposed to be included in our room package. Can you imagine wasting someone's 15 mins in morning when everyone is hurrying up to catch up important meetings scheduled for the day?   Their website clearly states that dinner is complimentary with club room and suite room. They denied for that and we didn't even argue for it. Their website says that we are eligible for reward points which can be redeemed later and they denied for the same. We agreed for that as well.   And then comes the most embarrassing

  This is my third stay in the last 4 months with the hotel and I have been fascinated by the consistency of services, commencing right from the reception till the checkout and everything in between.   the only con that I can think of this property is that this is a hotel which is relatively old.    Vintage is fine but some renovations are due.  It is being currently rennovated I believe.   I highly recommend the services of Ms. Laxmi and Nilam, who were kind and considerate enough to make my stay as cosy as possible

  The Orchid Hotel in Vile Parle, Mumbai is almost on the gates of the domestic airport. It also serves the Bandra Kurla Complex.  Orchid easily qualifies for a luxury hotel, but the room rate came as a pleasant surprise. It was less than half the standard rate at the usual luxury hotel in a mega city like Mumbai. However, the economy did not percolate to the restaurants. Our room, lowest in the rack, was spacious, well appointed and clean. The en suite bath was what it should be in a luxury hotel. The room had no fridge. At the time we checked out, when asked, we were informed that the hotel could have provided one if asked. The room service was efficient and prompt.  The reception was, I must admit, a bit of an unpleasant affair. For reasons unknown to us, a frown, not a smile,

  We stayed here for 4 nights and enjoyed our stay overall. The location is good. We took a prepaid a/c taxi from the international airport for Rs. 310. Uber would’ve been cheaper but our cellular data was not working at that time. The hotel is old but the staff was great. We had gotten a room with breakfast included so we ate in the South Indian restaurant twice and the multi-cuisine restaurant twice. We definitely prefer the South Indian place for the ambience and the quality of food. Everything worked in the room except the sink drained very slowly. We reported this to the cleaning staff but should have reported to the reception. The problem didn’t get fixed but the asst. manager called us later to apologize.   Overall a good experience though a bit pricey.

The moment I approached the front desk for checkout, I was asked to hand over the room keys first. Well ! Rooms: really tired, old and smelly. The room I got was smelling really bad.

  very disappointing to see the up keep of the place. Furniture worn out,polishing required,curtains dirty and old ,wash room with hair ,not cleaned properly, crockery cutlery below par, food rate rocketing for the quality and type of services, serving dishes dented. Cable tv showed continuous message that services stopped due to bounced cheque. For every thing delivered cash has to be paid immediately no room postings allowed. Miserable stay. I am so happy that i checked out. Wake up Mr.GM. You need to take round of your property. Promoters you need to pump in revenue for rennovations. Lift so poor condition that you feel you are in an ITDC hotel. Mattress sunken. I could not find one thing right for the amount they charge. Look around. Smaller unbranded properties have better up

Air conditioning in the room was powerful too. Mandatory welcome drinks were nice.  We'd booked mid night buffet and the spread was good. We'd like to thank Ms. Priya and Ms. Nilam from Guest Relations. Mr. Vikas and Mr. Mahesh from Boulevard/Buffet team and Mr. Sujeet from Room Service.  Property and hospitality is highly recommended.

  It was during monsoon, my brother has to leave for Germany, so thought of going one day early due to weather. Booked this hotel. It took us some time to figure out in which lane the hotel is situated. Staff at the reception was polite. Considering other hotels near the airport, Rooms of this hotel are big. As you know i love roof top restaurants, they have one, named Mostly Grills, along with a Pool. Since, it was raining, so couldn't eat there.  So, went down to the restaurant - South of Vindhyas. Man! they have the best south indian food :)   Next day, after dropping my brother to the airport, had buffet breakfast, i came back. All in all, it was a nice trip

  I stayed at Orchid for a couple of days on a business trip. This hotel has a fabulous location - close to the Mumbai domestic airport, about 5 kms from the Juhu beach. the staff here are courteous and the hotel also provides complimentary pickup and drop services to the domestic airport (not for Jet Airways, which I travelled and which lands at the International terminal). The choice of food here is great and so is the quality. The rooms are spacious, but my room had no view - I was mostly looking at the side of a wall, thanks to the strange structure of the building. The most disappointing aspect was the gym - it was small, stuffy and had a small window. It was probably smaller than my room. I was expecting a lot better from a 5 star. If tis was a 4 star hotel, I would have

While checking in I was told that Smoking Room is available though I wanted to a non Smoking room.I accepted it thinking that I will manage and it was late.But after an hour I found that the room was smelling very badly and had to go down again to request for a change in my room. This again took much time and I was finally given a room and was told that my luggage would be sent asap. Again when I did not get it in 10 minutes, I had to go down again to get it done.

  Hi everyone, To be honest never ever book this hotel as I was on business tour from London and during that journey I booked this hotel near Mumbai airport and I had arranged to see my family and friends and this hotel staff were very rude and no cooperative at all and I made a request to allow them in to my Premiere business room and they didn’t allow my relatives and friends to see me in my room . I was told you can sit in lobby room then what’s the point of my own business room to have privacy with my family relatives and friends and I couldn’t see them in Orchid hotel , really disappointed and annoyed with hospital staff and manager, they were laughing while I requested them and I had to go outside in different restaurant to see them, 2nd thing I booked premier business room

  I came to Mumbai on a business trip with my colleagues. They tried to serve us better but failed to do due to lack of coordination among staffs. They put us in club room but every night there used be a party on the roof which lasted till 3 am or so. Too noisy and then once part y was done, there were noises from cleaning staff removing furniture. We complained so they changed our room after 2nd night. The only good thing about this hotel is the breakfast and dinner. They have amazing chefs that make mouth watering dishes. Since this hotel is close to airport, they get guests who stay only for one night. If you want to stay for longer, ask specifically not to allot top floor in the club area.

The lobby is always crowded, is small and does not give you a great feel though there is  a stunning water feature installation in the centre of the lobby. I can ignore these things but i was greatly dismayed at being asked during check-in to get a pre-authorisation of Rs 15000/- done on my credit card through which I was supposed to make payment on checkout. This when I was a Corporate guest!!! The food is good and the buffet breakfast offers a wide variety of dining options. The room service was quick and the feedback call after that was a good gesture. however I must say that the food is slightly overpriced.

Check in process was simple, and special comments for Priya who made it even simpler with her clarity over the whole process. Once in, rooms were cosy. However, I would recommend some upgrading of the upholstery and automation. Otherwise, smooth room service food is definitely more than palatable. A good stay....

My special thanks and gratitude to Miss Priya Thingalaya for her support and help during my back trip from Hidersbad (I appreciate it). Thanks to all of you and see you on my next visit to Mumbai.

  The Orchid Mumbai had a fabulous 3 nights package which we as a family availed while on a short vacay to Mumbai ....  This was a great value package and the hotel manager upgraded us to a suite !  Check in and check out was smooth .... the staff at front desk is very efficient !  The suite is great and well appointed ... however the place badly requires a revamp as it reminded me of the 80’s /90’ s style of hotel rooms / lobby !  Breakfast in the coffee shop .... quality of food was good .... what can make a huge difference is managing the crowd during breakfast .... surprisingly it’s a free for all sitting !  Otherwise the breakfast spread is good. Overall a very good hotel with a fantastic location. Needs to be revamped to stay in competition with the newly built Taj Santacruz

  Me and my friend were on a short stay at the orchid as we had to fly the next day to Dubai. We chose this hotel as it close to the airport. I can say that I wish I could have stayed here for long as the hotel is really good and has such professional staff. I am a foodie and the best about this hotel is the food they serve. I and my friend both enjoyed the Saturday brunch. Lavish spread of salads and main course. The best were the spread of desserts . A real value for money. The rooms are also decent and very clean. The staff also is very warm and I loved the way they do Namashkar. I was really impressed by the Indian culture they have adopted .

What fantastic breakfast. I was so impressed. I really felt bad that I was travelling alone and I wish my family also would have been here to enjoy the same. I did send them pics.

  I stayed at The Orchid for 1 night only and wanted to provide my thoughts on the same:  Pros 1. Beautiful rooms with a separate bedroom and lounge area 2. Excellent rooftop swimming pool area 3. Convenient location as it is literally a 10 mins walk from the domestic airport and a half hour drive to Juhu beach.   Cons 1. Check in process was extremely slow and the front desk staff kept addressing the needs of the most rowdy customers who kept butting in, leaving people who were standing in line to wait  2. Look and feel of the hotel is very 80s. Maybe it's just me, but the wooden panels on the wall, the cramped corridors and the yellow lighting in the hotel made it feel like a swanky hotel from the 1980s. The interiors could be made to feel a little more modern and not look like

  Yeah that is one of the criteria and it takes only six minutes to reach here from airport. So this is primarily a business hotel. But being five star it has conglomerated quite a number of amenities those you have to paise. There roof top pool and spa especially grotesque message parlour in a narrow suffocating space under a stair case needs a mention. They have good gym, I heard. It's plan of architecture is a square inside space with a big fountain and multiple lifts carry you to your rooms arranged on periphery, lots of space saving manoeuvres. But the staffs are really friendly except those who will carry only soap first as toiletry and if asked second time for shampoo supplies shampoo only and not the conditioner or lotion even if you expect it and can not tell.

My Room was comfortable and clean. Food is good. Breakfast spread is good. Pool area is also very relaxing. Would recommend the Butter Chicken.  I can say that the only thing I felt was out date and regressive was that I was not allowed to get outside food in my room.

I have been a member of the orchid Gold for the last 3 years and appreciate for all the services provided by them all the time. We love the place - Fort Jadhav gadh, pune the best location for an ideal destination. And especially the authentic food at The Vindhyas, ville parle, its the best place for the sea food lovers. and the service and the welcome they have at the restaurant is awesome. The manager, Mr. Lenell and the steward, Mr. Madhusoodan were the best. Mr. Kalpesh at the Boulevard has always been co-operative.

  Awful best describes my experience at the Orchid Ecotel! Try walking out with a half eaten muffin in your hand from the Buffet area or a cup of coffee you are still concluding. You will be walked by the staff and prohibited till you are done with both in the main area. The Orchid Ecotel also does not believe in serving water to folks in glasses, instead a vey non eco friendly tiny plastic bottle is placed for every individual on the table. Take as much plastic as you need at the Orchid Ecotel. The rooms are such that there is a wall of wood, which has the cabinets plonk in the centre of the room, splitting it into two. The AirCon however, cools only the sitting area and not the bedsides. The staff could do with plenty of training and the food,uhhhh.   All in all, I know of three

The domestic airport is a 5 minutes walk, and cabs are available just outside the hotel. Overall a very comfortable stay.

  My experienced with them start in this way: try to book someone to take me from airport to hotel with the hotel excuse me sir yes we can pick you up but you have to paid. I said what????? Why should be service from hotel they give me a thousand of reason why they want to charge and basically they charge four time regular price so don't paid and take that deal. I have to said the staff most of them where amazing they care of each one of his costumer 100 point for that... the food was ok i will change the menu is a bit old and try to innovate i eat only vegetarian my favorite dish was the veg lasagna. The breakfast has diversity 100 points. The bar is ok the staff is great but i will recommend clean deep. For the room is very comfortable the only think was the pillow i didn't like

  If you are expecting a 5* ultra modern hotel you will be disappointed here.  If you are looking for a reasonable price (for Mumbai) hotel near the airport that is clean and quiet then you’ve come to the right place.   That being said this place has got some nice amenities.  The on site restaurant is convenient and pretty tasty.  The on-site bar has a good beer, wine and liquor selection. I highly recommend you request a highest floor possible room as the rooms on the lowest floor or two tens to get a little musty, at least during monsoon. Our stay included the breakfast buffet and it was pretty good.

The buffer breakfast was good and had a variety of local as well as international the floor Mgr was super he always made it a point to check on us and make us feel comfortable and giving few tips for us to do our shopping .

And if we talk about rooms , room size is ok but they gave us the rooms in their old constructed wing although I also stayed in their newly wing also during my earlier business trip, don’t know what is the criteria for stay in new wing. At last what they are charging is not obviously worth.only good thing abt hotel is their breakfast buffet.

  We booked considering this to be a 5* hotel. However, everything offered by the hotel was not at par with the 5* rating. Only interesting thing was the private museum inside the hotel having great collection of 17th/18th century art crafts &amp; utensils etc. In general, the hotel staff was very helpful &amp; courteous. Though the building is old, it was fairly maintained (but not the level what is expected from a 5*). Positive is the locations; near to the airport and also adjacent to he highway. One surpring rule of the hotel is that you can not bring outside food in the hotel!!

  The Orchid is past its best by date. Way past.  Our room (324) was stinking and dusty.  The window hadn’t been cleaned. The bathroom mirror too had smudges. When housekeeping tried to rectify the odour they, by their own admission, sprayed ‘some chemical’ in the room and made it worse. Simple room fresheners, guys? Impossible to sleep in that smell.  The taps, door handles, tub fringe, hooks, etc. are certainly not of even a three-star hotel standard, old and shabby.  The mattress was old and hard and bed linen dirty. Thankfully I only had one sleepless night. Of course, the housekeeping boy said, ‘sorry’ but does that erase a lousy experience.? The sheets were not tucked in properly. Well-made beds are de rigeur in any hotel.  At check-in we were told you can’t charge any

  So, not what I expected from my last visit to Orchid. The first time we visited this hotel, it was only for dinner. And I must say, it was a wonderful experience. Their buffets are delicious and they have a wide variety of options to choose from. So this time round, hands down we also opted to stay at Orchid. They have a lovely old world decor which is very charming. But I must admitted that the water fountain right at the center steals the show. Their rooms, carpets in the corridor, lamp shades etc also have the old world charm. However, the most disappointing part of our stay was the bed/mattress. Itvwas extremely hard and we could feel the springs beneath. We couldn't sleep at all on the first night and we ended waking up with sore backs. The next day though when we

  You won't be able to believe that such hotels exist even after charging 7k-8k per night. I had stayed only for 1 night but with worst experience. Every corner of the hotel is asking for repair. Looks like some old king has given his property to this group when nine of them can maintain the property. Worst part was AC.  It was so humid (not cool) that it feels like room has been washed. I don't know what was the reason...may be they are using air cooled system and not air conditioned. Don't waste your money. If budget and timing allows, then try Waterstones near to airport. One of the best hotel stayed ever.

It was wonderful view from the terrace swimming pool.  One side is the runway and a little shanty town.  So if you are stopping for one night this is ideal. The swimming pool was nice.  Around the pool was a bar and restaurant which had a Mexican feel to it with arches and mosaics.  Nice. The annoying things were.....when I ordered a beer I was charged the equivalent of £10 for a small bottle.  My fault as didn't check the menu.  So be aware of that!

May be it's the choise I made, as always I used to buy a chocolate cake and it used to be the best. But this time there was no chocolate available and hence had to buy a pineapple cake. The pineapple was not good. Wish I had waited and got a chocolate cake made.

The 3 storey fountain in the reception gives you a soothing feeling as soon as you enter the hotel. But even before that there are carefully selected plants at the entrance- a banana tree laden with raw bananas, reminds you that you are on the green coast of Konkan. The swimming pool on the terrace just washed away my stress and then I was eager and hungry to relish the food. The food is costly but the variety they offer and the way it is presented and served gives you a total organoleptic culinary experience.

  This is my third time staying here. This third time was by far the best experience I’ve had at a hotel.   We received wonderful, personalized service every step of the way. I can’t say enough good things.   Special kudos go out to Laxmi from guest services. She took great interest in making our stay comfortable and made us feel at home. She even played with our 4 year old son who really likes her now.   Also, kudos to Wesley the concierge who was an excellent resource for us. He was quite helpful in looking after our bags and finding us reliable taxis. He made our stay that much easier.   The entire bell staff was very helpful and personable with us. Each one of them greeted us warmly with a smile.   I really feel like The Orchid is my home in Mumbai now. I won’t stay anywhere

  We were visiting from the USA for a short trip. We were so disgusted with this hotel and would not recommend anyone, this is not even a 2 star hotel overall. We stayed in this hotel because it was FIve star and close to the airport, I am not sure where to start to tell my experience. First, lets talk about the front desk. We arrived late evening in the hotel for a 6 hour sleep and next morning we had to catch the flight and had to wait in line for a long time to speak to the front desk who looked so stressed out and no smiles. Once we got into the room, what a terrible smell we experienced in the room. Next door guest was shouting so loudly that we could not sleep. We had to call the security several times to have him calm down. We had 5 hours at that time to sleep and check

  Lovely hotel, we stayed here for a day while waiting for our flight from the very nearby airport. Staff were amazing, rooms gorgeous and the food was incredible from room service and restaurants, breakfast was lovely mix of Indian and European. Rooftop pool was Ok, covered with netting which I presume keeps the pigeons off and some rather random rules (for instance they had horrible plastic shower cap for long hair and your maid servants not aloud in pool!) but great for a couple of hours in the sun and quick dip - as long as you are not a maid, there's a small gym (a few dumbbells, one multi machine, a running machine and rowing machine(I think), there were staff there ready to give massage etc, although we didn't use them.

Each time stayed at a different hotel in a different area and must say this one has by far been the best stay.  Very courteous staff, amazing choice of restaurants and food.  Spacious rooms, very comfortable bed and a switchboard right next to it that controls it all. Don't have to get up. A 2 minute drive to the airport, just what we needed in our 14 hour stay at Mumbai.

  Sterile, mediocre and western in all the wrong ways. I booked this hotel for three days to get away from now what I know is a better spot in Mumbai. For a one night stay this is a fine airport hotel, but do not book if you are staying longer. It is extremely far away from any fun in the city and rather depressing. The breakfast is a good deal if you are a breakfast person, but I really only eat fruit and drink tea in the morning. Being stuck here was my worst three days in India. The only good thing is the spa, which is not even apart of the hotel!   If you find yourself stuck here go to the rooftop to catch the sunset. There are tours of the slums on trip advisor. I can’t stomach poverty tourism, but I hear it is enlightening for some other people.   I was told I needed a swim

Everything from the service to the rooms was amazing!! The rooms were very clean and the staff was very polite. Specifically, we were waited on by Varun and he was great! He was extremely attentive, polite, friendly and had a wealth of knowledge regarding things to do and see in the area. If you stay in Mumbai, I highly recommend staying here, it’s a beautiful hotel. Also, take a trip upstairs to the rooftop bar and visit Varun, he will make your trip ten times better!! Enjoy!

One could sit in the coffee shop or the restaurant and enjoy the soothing sound of water.   The rooms are also functional and the information regarding various rooms were laid out succinctly.  It has rooftop pool and gym. The only hitch has bene that the gym was very small and cramped.   The breakfast spread was elaborate with fresh juice. A good option when transiting through Mumbai.

This year a special thanks to Wesley Manager of the Concierge who was extremely helpful in repairing our suitcases at such short notice. Nothing is ever too much problem for the staff at this hotel.  Couple of suggestions:-  Regular guests should be able to check in at Guest Relations, as I find that Reception staff seem to change often and being a regular guest, I do not feel the friendliness and familiarity is present with the reception staff, like it is with the concierge staff.  The gym/ Health club does not provide any male masseurs for any male massages.  Special Thank You to Laxmi on Guest Relations for being so

  An exemplary example of discriminatory policies. A snooty, sluggish, and an ineffective management that lacks decision making abilities and humanity as well.   We booked two rooms for 4 nights.   The duty manager Ms. Soniya was absolutely non cooperative, arrogant and a poor example for this hospitality industry. She just lost a 10 year old client for her hotel.   My grandfather is a 81 year old diabtetic patient. We got some low calorie food for him made to his taste from a nearby place. The hotel was of the opinion that Outside food is not allowed. But at that exact moment i see a guest getting alcohol from outside. On enquiry, the security head was of the opinion that outside food is not allowred but outside alcohol and Beverages are allowed.

Also some of restaurant staff would order us the wrong drink or food because they didn't really understand English, which is fine but they should maybe reconfirm orders before placing them.

  This hotel, while not a new property by any means, is fantastic in terms of location.   Located just a stone's throw away from the Mumbai Domestic Terminal, it is a boon for business travellers, who have to either take early morning or late night flights in or out of Mumbai. Also the Int'l terminal is not too far.  Has a good range of restaurants and the food has always been nothing to write home about but above average.  Has a roof-top swimming pool and a pretty well equipped fitness centre.... though, i do not think i a qualified to comment on them, as I didn't end up using these facilities  What i found really interesting was the 'Aai Musuem'. If you do have the time please indulge in it.. It showcases the day-to-day artefacts used in almost every Indian home between 1950s ~

And when its Goa, how can Mumbai be far behind. This is how The Orchid Hotel came in the scene.  I am glad that I went ahead with this plan because my experience of this hotel is nothing short than extraordinary. The first thing which was in my mind was that the Hotel should be near the airport. After carefully surfing the internet, The Orchid caught my attention.  Even the address of this place says near domestic airport, Vile Parle so there was no question about the traveling. Just exit the airport and this place is not even a kilometer away. The Orchid is a luxury hotel and can be easily located form far

The best thing about the hotel is the reception area where there is a centre piece of a fountain. We did not have breakfast as it was very expensive so we went to nearby veggie restaurant shiv sagar.  Just a cup of coffee  on it's own was 300 rupees.

Brunch buffet was great with many varieties from desi chaat, India veg and non veg delicacies to wide choice of desserts.  Apple jalebi, walnut halwa and strawberry halwa were superb.  Chicken vindaloo and lollipop were nice, paani puri was mouth watering.  Service was prompt, the place was full of people but the hotel staff managed to take care of guests.  Special thanks to manager Mr. Vishal Hate and staff. Vishal made sure that we received nice service.  10 out of 1o if you want to visit with family for Sunday brunch.  The next 3 visits were with friends to roof top lounge ""Mostly Grills"". Amazing place with great view of Mumbai airport and beyond. Drinks and cocktails

  We stayed at the Orchid for 2 nights in January 2018. My partner was on a business trip and I had tagged along to visit friends hence I was left to my own devices during the day. I cannot thank the staff at the hotel enough for going out of the way to help me with transport, booking local cabs/Uber and ensuring that I was taken care of. Mr Wesley Fernandes, Asst Manager/ Concierge was especially attentive and helpful with any concerns I may have had during my stay.

  I don't know how many times i had stayed in this hotel, but the last stay was in November 2017 when I went for CPHI India show. I stayed here 1 night. Unlike normal times, the booking was not done in advance. I just dropped in around 6 pm and since all hotels were fully booked due to CPHI Exhibition in Mumbai, which is a big international exhibition for Pharma companies, they initially told me very high rates, but I negotiated well and got a reasonable rate (which was still higher than the normal tariff). the room as usual was well maintained and good, peaceful, i had nice sleep in the hotel. The rooms are reasonably big and well decorated. The staff members are always pleasing and nice, ready to serve.. You have 2 food choices, one in the buffet restaurant on first floor,

I was promptly and happily upgraded to an executive room situated on the sixth floor. The room service was quick and in room dining experience was also good.

  I stayed in this hotel couple of times. This is a very busy hotel and always packed with guests due to conferences and meetings. The location of hotel is decent. Due to high rush, hotel staff find difficulty to take care of individual guests. Once they gave my booked room to some other guest who come for short period. Due to which I did not get my booking till 4 pm. I had a very poor experience in the room located in old wing ( not renovated as in new wing). Dirty linen, poor quality of mattress and un-hygienic  condition of bathroom. My latest visit happened on a week back and I requested for newly renovated rooms in new wing 1st floor but hotel staff refused to provide it.

  The Orchid is stuck in the 70s with furniture clearly dating from that era. Rooms are not clean and the lifts get stuck! The hotel gym is the smallest I’ve ever been in and is smaller than some toilets. It’s also a maze trying to get around in the hotel. Only redeeming feature perhaps is the rooftop restaurant which has a nice ambience. Definitely not coming back.

  It is supposed to be a five star hotel but I will classify this more like a 4 star. They behave like a 4*. The lobby seems to be too cramped up and very dim, giving a feeling of a little discomfort. The location is good but the access is suddenly by turning into a narrow lane from the main road, which can be scary during late hours if you are coming for the first time. The rooms are comfortable and the washrooms are well laid. However, you can make out the ageing on the furniture in the room and sanitary ware. It does not seem like they are trying hard to change things. The breakfast is although large, is not well laid and the breakfast room itself on the first floor is a bit cramped. Overall, good hotel if you are willing to overlook a few things in the hotel quality.   By the

  Bills itself as a 5 star, and certainly did not meet any definition of that i've ever seen or experienced.  But that said, it's probably nice for Mumbai. Took a private taxi to hotel from airport and was very short ride (maybe 10 mins). The room was not bad size. with a work desk, free WiFi, power outlets at desk, small frig, closet, sitting area.  No iron or ironing board in room but was provided on request.  Most staff seemed to speak good enough English.  Buffet breakfast was not bad, with a moderate selection of western items and made to order omelet available.   Room itself lacked care and craftsmanship.  Pergo style wood floors had gaps all over, and the room had numerous elevation changes.  Beside bed and sofa in sitting area was a control for all the lights, but good

I requested the Duty manager , sonia to help me out by arranging one , without listening or showing any empathy she refused to offer help by stating it's not in the purview of the hotel .

The floor manager takes an active but discrete role in streamlining all the traffic arriving at his front door. Coming in from hot, humid Mumbai, the air-conditioning did not disappoint and I was not sorry I had worn the suit.     The room was fresh with crisp linen. The bathroom had all the trimmings.

The floor planks had gaps between them and they creaked at some spots.   Washroom looked okay, but again, the modeling is possibly from early 2000.

  Many of the awards / commendations received by the hotel and displayed in the lobby are several years old. This plus the dated interiors gave me the impression that the hotel is past its prime.  My room stank of cigarette smoke and had one or two non-functional switches. I expected much better from a room for which I paid around 15K INR a night.

  Went on a business trip to Mumbai and had a few domestic flights to take. This hotel was the perfect location for the Domestic airport. It is a decent hotel with a good level of cleanliness. The good points include a great breakfast buffet also a good traditional vegetarian indian breakfast downstairs. The roof top bar and restaurant is great too with live music and a great grill although i think its highly priced for what it is . The roof top pool is decent but only had 4 sunbeds. The staff are very polite and very helpful . All in all i enjoyed my stay here and will use this hotel again should i go on another business trip here

  Hi Varun, General Manager Greetings. It was an wonderful stay at your hotel in Mumbai from 11.12.2017 -12.12.2017. I stayed with my friend from CPCL Chennai. I am Selvi Ravindran, working as Addl General Manager, BHEL- Chennai. I came for an official meeting at Mumbai and your Hotel was booked thru our BHEL-ROD Mumbai.  The staff at the Front desk deserve kudos for going out of their way. When I landed Mumbai from Shrirdi, I could not find an ATM to withdraw money since most of the machines didn’t have cash. I have reached the hotel and requested the front desk gentleman , ( I Didn’t remember his name on 11th Dec’18 at 8.00 pm) to help me to lend Rs 2600/- to pay off the taxi driver for short of cash. He immediately responded after talking to his seniors.  This is the place to

It was also about 40 mins drive to the Phoneix mall in mumbai and was prfect for a short shopping in mumbai Though we did not have enough time to visit the local market which we were told is also nearby.

They make up amply and more in the people t0-people management aspect. Right from the security person at the entrance to the Chairman they can teach veterans people management. In fact when I was trying to figure out the restaurant a gentleman guided me to the door of the restaurant and then he said he was the Chairman of the hotel!!  Well done.  Regards AGopal 9786666687

  Business stay for a week. Both restaurants are pretty good - downstairs South Indian and the rooftop. I didn’t try the buffet 1st floor but found the service there a bit erratic. The rooftop is a nice ambiance particularly if the live music is decent (which on this night it was). Ate there twice and first time service was a bit faulty. Second time I was luckier. I would recommend Salman and Maxwell - charming but professional.  Breakfast was fine. We had a problem with receiving a shipment which required a letter from the hotel. This took 4 days. Poor service there at management level.  That said, it’s a comfortable hotel well located for the airport where some of the staff really make the difference ((the 4th star is for them)

  One of the best hotels in Mumbai.  Staff are extremely friendly, courteous &amp; professionally efficient.  Food quality and variety is very good, on the expensive side though.  Housekeeping is very efficient and professional  Complementary breakfast is very good with all varieties and options available.  They have one weird rule though, which prevents guests from taking outside food to the room, which I felt is very very unfair. Every city had its specialty eateries. And Mumbai has plenty. Guests should have the freedom to bring a parcel and have the food in the comfort of their room.

  If you are looking for a reasonable place to stay around domestic Airport, Orchid is one of the options. This place offers bare essentials. Don't expect the place to be 100 hygiene friendly for the price you pay for the Club rooms. They can't even provide basic amenities like iron and iron board and should the amenities be not available have the courtesy to inform or find alternate solution. After repeated reminders and a bit of abuse I got a dilapidated iron with a table cloth which got set on the business desk. I had to miss my breakfast because of the delay and inefficiencies of the staff. This is not the first and unique instance and it is only because of repeated experience and feedback to the management I thought of sharing it with the masses as I would like to believe

  The Hotel can be made a lot better if little attention is given to detail. The room was not clean when we checked in. During breakfast the chicken sausages were oily and salty and table mats were smelling. Mango milkshake was like WATER. Yes!!! It was watery. Being in such a hotel where you add water to your milkshakes really says a lot about your kitchen management and how they dont bother about the quality of food served.  Hot milk was NOT hot But the high light of our stay was   1)The airport service pick up( Rohit who picked us up and guided us to our pick up. He was very helpful and courteous  2) Hema the hostess who greeted us at breakfast. She was always courteous, humble and always had a smile on her face unlike the other hostess at the live counter in the black suit.

The hotel is a visual delight in every way - from the lobby to its view from the elevators, the beautiful corridors outside the rooms, the restaurants, it seems like no cost was spared to make  the hotel luxurious.  Firstly, it provides the sheer convenience of being near the airport which is very important for new travellers to the city. Secondly, the hotel experience itself helps to cement a 5-star experience which guests naturally expect from a luxurious hotel such as this and The Orchid did live up to it.  The service was certainly very pleasant and attentive. A very quick reservation experience. And a room that was thoroughly cleaned and ready.

The complimentary breakfast was delicious - heaps to choose from.   I stayed here as a solo female traveller and I felt safe &amp; respected.   It would have been nice for the hotel to include a shuttle to the international airport - they only offer a free shuttle to domestic, so I had to pay a further $20 for a 5 minute taxi ...

  Just wonder, what was right in my 2 night stay; right from check in experience to a cramped room to used bed sheets and so on. It’s a run down property mostly used by business travelers. Cause of proximity to domestic airport has a foot fall and is able to hold the 5* tag.   Co would do well to spend and bring some life / shine to the stars.   The Merlyn Karaoke &amp; Bar with mostly Bollywood songs, was a thin silver line to the whole experience.

Front office staff is well mannered. I was given a complimentary upgrade. Thanks for that. Midnight buffet is worth every penny and great biryani.  If you are interested in off the routine mundane breakfast, head to vindhyas. Typical southern cuisine served in small platters. Tip: Avoid gourmet shop. Nothing is impressive. Also try to get rooms with airport runway view.

  Good hotel but easily one on the expensive side.  The minute you check in the hotel staff wants to swipe ur card for an amount over ur normal stay charges - as they expect you to eat or use some additional services. Which I thought was unusual specially in a corporate booking instance.  They have one great south indian restaurant but i guess thats all one has to write home about! Complimentary Airport transfer they offer is for the domestic airport which is like walking distance. (Not that the international airport is too far, but its not on)

  Hotel is OK. No more.  Lobby is nice and  functional. Rooms are good sized.  I had a split level room with a living area.  I booked a non smoking room but they only had a smoking room. If you are sensitive to this, be ware. Room was very stuffy. No opening windows. No external sunlight as my room was facing to the internal court.  Expected a bathrobe in a 5 star hotel, that was wishful thinking. It is an older hotel that looks like it has had no investment in it for years.  Could be a nicer property.

  Firstly, I'm a frequent traveler to Mumbai, like once a week, and use 3 hotels at similar price bracket depending on my location of engagement. Orchid is one. I am a regular guest for a year now and have lost count how many times I have stayed there.  Surprisingly, unlike any other hotel nationwide I regularly stay, Orchid gives absolutely no recognition to repeat visits! Everywhere else (about 15 hotels nationwide) they atleast greet me with ""Welcome back Mr Roy"". In Orchid, I have to write down everything from my email ID to non-smoking preference everytime I checkin, not only wasting time but irritating after a days work. Happened again just 2 days back when I was there last week. Hence the heading. It's either a problem with their backend processes which doesn't flag off a

Then there was a goof up in alloting rooms. Then the rooms were so detoriated and unclean so called the Duty manager. He was a robot. That machine just addressed all my frustation and said will solve it and call you. And the call never came Just keeping smiling girls for welcoming and irritating you by good evening every 2 minutes better concentrate on your main staff the guys who attend the clients.

  The location of the hotel is excellent being minutes away from Domestic and International airports. We had booked an executive room through Agoda and the check in process was very quick with us being escorted to our room with our luggage within 10 minutes.   The hotel is advertised as 5 star however we having stayed at a number of hotels the previous 3 weeks we would not class this as 5 star when compared with e.g. Hilton in Jaipur, Hilton New Garden in New Delhi or Radisson Blu in Agra. These had better bathrooms also provided bath robes, better toiletries and slippers for guests.  Orchid’s room decor was good but the bathroom a bit dated.  The buffet breakfast had an excellent choice of hot foods, egg and Indian dosa cooked to order. We also had the evening buffet dinner with

I had sent 2 mails, one with request second one with flt details. I looked for my name board on arrival..did not find it. Upon calling up the hotel, found out that since transfer from airport is at chargeable basis, they are not picking me up. I read out my mail, requested him but no...was no. The person at the airport was really sensible..he said he will get me Uber. In the meantime, hotel called again

Upon arrival it looks nice - the fountain in the foyer, the restuarant on the first etc look quite opulent.  However, from there on the impression went down.  I've never had an issue with tipping and am happy to do so, but the way the bell-hops grabbed my bag, walked (the short distance) to my room and then stood in the door until I tipped left me feeling uncomfortable.  The room looked nice, with a seating area slightly separated from the bed.  However a smell of damp become more apparent the longer I stayed in the room,and the furniture all felt slightly wet (I've stayed in other hotels in India and plenty of places with aircon - this was different.)

  Indian people are crazy about conditioners. Even at home rich families never open the windows. So my review will be odd in somebody who is local in Mumbai. But as a westerner, I prefer my window wide open - at least sometimes - and breathing some air. Yes, air in Mumbai is not so clean as somewhere in Goa, but anyway, I would like to have a choice to open a window. In a room where window is like the glass wall I feel like in a prison.   Another thing - some people prefer to wash some items by themselves. Yes, yes, I know there is laundry service and it is reasonable to use it if somebody wants to wash the suit or other big items. But I would like to wash my underwear or t-shirt in the room and hang it somewhere to dry. There is no such possibility. That is why I prefer to stay

  It must be 5th or 6th visit but special cause lived their for 3 nights. All is same as hospitality food rooms and.of.course so many people that you have to spend minimum 15 minutes at reception. Room was big suite type where bad and sitting has nice partition. Ate dinner once there nice combo meal. Bathrooms are olden type where taps are old fashioned cumbersome at times. Bathroom doors so heavy that it will open on its own unless locked. The best thing is smiling staff who never forget to wish you with smiling NAMASKAR. It touches please keep it up.

  Not impressed at all.. I should have rather booked another hotel next to the airport. There are better options. Tried to get a half day rate when I booked by hotel confirmed there are not half day rates. First thing I get asked at the hotel why I didn't book a half day. Seriously. OK, I explained why and of course no change to full day price possible. Thanks for that. Restaurant price is a complete rip-off though. 15 AUD for a bottle of Corona? Seriously... Asked for a pick up from the terminal... not possible. Really, for an airport hotel? Glad that they offered at least drop-off but wanted 10 times the price for a regular cab. Seriously? Room was spacious and fairly clean. However, a very annoying hissing sound was present in that room. So no sleep at all.

  One of the most amazing experience in terms of hospitality.. the GM Mr. Varun Sahani along with his very able staff made my stay very comfortable and enjoyable. Also their South Indian restaurant serves very authentic food.

  We chose The Orchid due to its proximity to the Mumbai Domestic Airport. Our main purpose was to spend a day in Mumbai, visit some must see places and enjoy the food. The Orchid fulfilled the location and part of our Food experience in Mumbai. It's rated 5 star Eco-Friendly hotel, the ambience and its services meet most of its rating.  Our room was clean, a bit smaller for a 5 Star room, but met our needs. We didn't find it noisy during night sleep time but could hear the noise from outside during the day.  We were also able to enjoy the Onam special Vegetarian  lunch, the hotel was celebrating it from Sept 3rd to 5th. Usually we do not like all you can eat lunches, but this was special and we did enjoyed most of it. It was typical Onam food, Kerala style, and with lots coconut

  I have stayed at Orchid for couple of times and the best part is the proximity to Airport both domestic and international terminal. Hotel offers a drop facility to airport.  The property is a bit old but I booked a club room which is like a suite. In $120-130 per night it's a brilliant option. Usually the room prices include breakfast and internet.   One area where the hotel should definitely improve is check in and check out process. It took me over 15 minutes to check in and check out because the hotel was charging incorrect GST. ( Tax component). Please do check it carefully because the tax has different slabs depending on your room rate and the hotel was charging the highest rate by default. They rectified it but only once we pointed the error.  Other than that good stay.

  The Hotel staff were polite and very very helpful at anytime of day or night. You were always treated in a way that made you feel special. The rooms are large and well appointed and this is an ECO Hotel so efforts are made to save energy whenever possible. Located near the airport and between North and South Mumbai it is a good base for exploring the city. Hotel cars and taxis are available at the door and security is very well looked after. I will be using this hotel again for my business trips. The only down side is that the food in the excellent hotel restaurants is expensive compared to those in town. That said, the coffee shop is open 24/7.

Beautifully decorated hotel, with all the necessary facilities that 5 star hotel should have. Top notch security with courteous staff, made our stay smooth and hassle free.  Rooms are quite large, neat and clean. Tariff is not all that high. But there are areas of improvement. When we checked in, after all the formalities at the reception, one of the hotel staff, escorted us, to our room, placed our luggages, and then just left. We are new, have absolutely no idea about different sections of the hotel, how many restaurants, how long they serve food, gym timings, library, location of them,

The Hotel has its grand, nostalgic charm to it.   Misses -  1) The Fitness and Spa Centre needs to be upgraded with equipment's.      The steam and Sauna Rooms look outdated.  Hits -  1) Hospitality - Definitely a Thumps Up on this!  The hotel staff was extremely polite, cordial &amp; understanding.  We were given a hand written note by the Front office once we checked in. This surely brings out the unique and personal touch here.  Special appreciation to Ms. Astha and her collogue at the front desk (Sorry, can not recollect the name) for their hospitality.

  The hotel is very close to the airport but you will not find any disturbances. However the location is a bit inside from the main road. Not much to explore around and the view from the room is also not spectacular. The check-in took time and when I finally got the room keycard I was left to fend for myself. The bellboy asked me to proceed and he will be right behind me with my luggage. Only there are nearly 70 rooms on a floor and by the time I found mine the bellboy was already there... Waiting. The corridors had a suffocating smell off old wet carpet but thankfully the room had tiles. The room was OK however the bed was little hard for a five star hotel. The buffet was amazing and I love the chaats (street food). The checkout was again time consuming. Overall I think I will be

  Located close to Mumbai domestic Airport on very poor approach road you arrive at an excellent property. With large lobby with friendly staff check in does not take much time. The guest rooms are large , comfortable bed, with eco friendly furniture, Toiletries are all organic. The hotel boast of a museum on the first floor , appears to be collection of the hotel founder. But it is closed on Sunday. Food is excellent , the staffs are helpful.  Unfortunately if you are out of the hotel surroundings are not good for walk around. However the exit side is somewhat better compared to entry side as quite a few hotels are on the same road.

  Great price, nice ambience &amp; and prompt service is synonym for this place. In close proximity to Airport T1, it is walking distance and a fav for most business travellers. The Staff is always smiling and ready to service. Like I was waiting in the front desk queue for extension of stay and a person comes down and takes me to his own desk and completes the requisites rather quickly. We tried their buffet in the evening and is full of options for veggie as well.

  The checkout was quick and the car to drop me in the terminal 1 was readily available. The room was clean, well equipped, maintained;  although I was not too comfortable with the layout of the room wherein the bed was down a couple of steps, almost like a mezzanine. May br this is may appeal as stylish to many guests, but for me it wasn't all that convinent. I was here only for the night, checkout at 5am, hence didn't get a chance to eat breakfast. It makes sense to stay here overnight, if you have an outbound early morning flight with those specific airlines departing out of Terminal1 of Chatrapati Shivaji Airport. Worth checking with the hotel upfront or while booking,  on their policy/price for transfer to Terminal 2.

  The best part of the hotel is the South Indian Restaurant. It is really, really good at least for breakfast. The hotel has an old school décor with glitzy lobby, etc. Lot of staff in the lobby, but totally inefficient. I was standing right in their face at the reception to check in with bags in hand, but they were all in their own confusion doing their stupid ""Orchid Namaskar"".  The room had musty smell due to lack of proper ventilation in Mumbai's humid weather. The hotel somewhat seems like a grand version of an average Udupi hotel

  We booked our room on MakeMyTrip and reached the hotel after a long day at work. While checking in the executives at the counter told us that they hadn't received confirmation from MMT and hence we will have to leave a credit card authorisation with them till they sort the issue with MMT. We agreed to this as we had had a long day but the issue just wouldn't get resolved from their side. We argued that its them who is selling their rooms on MMT and MMT's confirmation email should be enough and that they should release our card's authorisation and take the matter up with MMT as it wasn't our concern. This went on till next evening till we checked out after making several calls to MMT and sorting the issue ourselves. Extremely unprofessional behaviour.

  High prices. Very worn out rooms. Apparently,  renovation has started on some floors but the higher floors have old rooms. We paid quite a high price for the rooms and thought breakfast was included but it was not; we had to top up INR900 per person_ of note  we stayed in another 4 star hotel in Mumbai with a lower price with breakfast.   No outsode food is allowed in the hotel and you have to go through security check where they search your every shopping bag when you enter the hotel. I agree its for security but after 2 days, you get quite sick of it.  The rooftop restaurant is quite nice- good ambiance and nice food.  Overall ok but would not visit again

  On Wednesday 6th July 2017 we had one of the craziest experience at this Hotel where we were staying. We returned to the hotel with some food from a local restaurant since we were not hungry when we were near the restaurant. The bag containing the food was x-rayed and told that outside food was not allowed in the hotel. The food was taken away and we were told that they would freeze it and hand it over to us at check out. We were compelled to eat over priced bad food at the hotel due to this crazy rule. Do check and verify what other crazy rules they have. Even hospitals these days do not have just restrictions.

  About the only good thing about this hotel is its location, almost next door to the domestic terminal. But this advantage is lost if your flight is from the new international​ terminal, because it is about half an hour from the hotel. Other than that, there is little to recommend. The food is just about ok, the main restaurant is cramped, the hotel approach is narrow and the decor is dated, though the rooms are spacious by Mumbai standards. However, the staff are quite unprofessional - I was asked to make payment in advance even though mine was a corporate booking. It felt especially bad as the person next to me at check-in was given the option of paying later.

This hotel does not allow any cooked food to be brought in from outside which is ok from perspective of hotel, however not for travellers.

The size of the room is just right.   Would like to point out the room service is quick and the quality of food is excellent.   However this time my visit was punctuated by credit card fraud. Unfortunately it was perpetuated by the hotel staff itself.   They take pre authorization on credit cards per room night. On this occasion they decided to use the same for another guests room. I was surprised that a debit was made to my account. When I checked out i was informed of the same.

So I ran back to the hotel which is walking distance from the domestic terminal and retrieved the same.  Apart from the location, the place has an amazing breakfast buffet spread. Gigantic! All varieties of food possible in the morning and different cuisines as well. Rooms are nice and quiet. In fact it is very quiet despite being near to the airport. If possible take the rooms near the fountain on the ground floor which gives a nice quaint feel with the sound of water flowing right at your door step!

  I stayed for 2 nights this time. I have stayed here earlier also. I like the fact that it is very close to the airport. The rooms are pretty decent. But that's about all. There is no view from the rooms . The food is extremely over priced and though they offer a large spread most of the dishes are tasteless. I therefore decided to bring some food from outside. I was stopped at the entrance and shown a small sign which said that outside food is not allowed. Now , this came as a surprise to me because it was not mentioned anywhere on their site as a policy. I then read some reviews where there was a mention by some guest who also had been taken by surprise. The response to the guests remark made me laugh. I had therefore no choice but to eat in their over priced restaurant.  These

A few months before the event, I was being well attended by Banquets team headed by Amit and other support staff. The menu on offer, overall ambiance and most importantly, the follow-ups and responses by Amit and team were quite impressive.

It was my parents wedding anniversary whilst we were there, we returned to our room to find a cake left for us. There are many restaurants in the hotel, we even had an evening on the terrace watching planes land. We were wonderfully looked after in this hotel, great rooms and stunning hotel.

  The Orchid is conveniently located close to the airport, and still in favour with older Indians. Not entirely sure when its hideous architecture was ever en vogue, but the desi design additions certainly didn't help. Rooms are dated, hallways stuffy, and the breakfast a gigantic disappointment.

  Never use google maps to navigate to this hotel if you take an uber from terminal 2.  The location is slightly off and the route is via the narrow lanes of the encroached slum areas of the airport. You're better off telling the cab driver to head towards terminal 1 via the elevated road and then turning off just before the airport intersection.  Location otherwise is great. Checkin was pleasant - took 5 mins and the room was overlooking the airport. Overall was comfortable but definitely could do with a bit of a spring clean as it seemed just a tad musty.  The restaurant for breakfast was exceptional and so was in room dining for dinner.  Would definitely stay here again as long as the price point is correct - their rack rates are not justified

The Guest relation manager sent a box of cookies and a personal greetings for choosing to stay with Orchid. Being very close to the domestic terminal, the pick up and drop facility is complimentary and fast. Good place to stay.

  We had booked a room for one-night and were completely disappointed with the room alloted on check-in. The room had an extremely unpleasant and muggy smell / odour; it smelt like the carpet in the room and the passage had not been cleaned for probably over 10-years. Made a request for a change of room which the hotel accommodated, but took them a few hours. Extremely thankful to Ms Samantha at the Front Desk who changed our room. The rooms in the new wing are much better and cleaner - but the moist and damp weather of Mumbai affects the carpeting in the passages. We had also made an advance booking at the spa, but were equally disappointed with the cleanliness and lack of maintenance in the spa - hence had to cancel our appointment.

  Poor arrival experience as they missed our pick up from the airport. After checking in got a surprise of a lifetime, As apparently they do not allow guest to bring their own food into the room.   I understand that nobody allows food into the restaurant or to the banquet venue. However failing to understand that how can one not allow someone to bring food into the room that they are staying in.   On top of that I was ready to sign a disclaimer on the food that I bring but still i was told that it is a management call not to allow outside food.   I asked the front desk team to connect with the duty manager and was pointed at a person and told that you can go and speak to the person who is sitting at the Duty Manager desk.  After I refused to walk up to someone to take permission

  Well I couldn't be bothered to take pictures of this one, it was alright, the bed blanket felt a little sticky. Bath tub had a rusted stain, ac wasn't good enough, entire room didn't really get cold. Surprisingly they have a fan over the bed, really?   So you enter the room, on your left is the shower then you walk in you have like a mini hall on the left with couches and then a cupboard that divides the room with the bed on the other side towards the end of the room on the left, a mirror in front of you in the bedroom,little creepy, view well let's just say keep the curtains closed.   Staff uh well... took forever to check in with a sad face to look at, and to checkout well let's say don't stand in line, just push forward like you would do to enter the train in Mumbai, don't

  Hotel is simply home away from home. Staff is friendly and very very co-operative.  Food is really nice at all the restaurants specially at boulevard cafe.

I called the front desk they transferred the call to their guest relations manager , to my surprise the lady on phone SWAPNALEE assured me not to worry and she rushed to the room with a new room key for an upgraded room. She first showed us the new room and immediately transferred us to the new upgraded room within minutes. This was a good room.   I once again thank SWAPNALEE for her quick response and understanding our needs.  It was a good experience staying at this hotel. Will surely recommend ORCHID to my friends and family.

  Stayed here twice. ""Upgraded"" to club room one time, but not sure it's much better. 6th floor, loud music until late, though the jet engine of an air conditioner easily drowned the sound. Given the AC, I have trouble believing the Eco status of the hotel. Can't believe they still have smoking rooms and don't ask guests their preference. Once I had to change rooms it stank so badly. Second visit it's again a smoking room judging by the ashtray, but luckily doesn't smell. Nice front desk staff. Wifi works well. Restaurant downstairs tasty. Might be ""5 star"" but not the nicest hotel I've stayed in.

An oasis from the hussle of Mumbai roads. The water feature at the entrance and inside the hotel has a very calming effect for tired travelers. Nature brought into a building. Lucky bamboo plant in the room makes the room feel like you are not in a hotel but at home. Areas not to miss:  1. The Vindhays great selection of veg for breakfast. 2. The Boulevard on the 1st floor..(24/7) Breakfast and guess what they have a buffet

  Orchid is an ecotel and a 5 star hotel. I stayed here in March 2017. The hotel reception area has a nice and royal old look. The rooms however seem like an average 3/4 star hotel. Given that it is an ecotel, the things in the room are recyclable but the walls have marks, the furniture kind of looks old, the bathroom is extremely small (for a 5 star). I have actually seen bigger bathrooms in a 3 star. The bathtub is small. The room size was good. It did feel comfortable. But, the overall look and feel seemed old, and not at all what you'd expect from a 5 star. Compared to other 5 stars in the area, Orchid is more of an ecotel and less of a 5 star. The proximity to airport is a plus point. Also, it is approx 15 min drive to Andheri Railway Station.  The prices are in line with

  Stayed with family end Jan/Feb 2017 and upgraded to club room at reasonable premium.....which was a good decision as the rooms are distinctly larger and better facilities are made available. Reception staff were friendly and check in and check out relatively stress free. The club lounge was well stocked and staff attentive. It's not in same league as some of the other 5 star Hotels in the area but I applaud their commitment to customer service and attention in ensuring your stay is comfortable.

  We stayed in this Orchid Mumbai Hotel for 3-nights Feb 25 to 28, 2017 on our way back from visiting India. We stayed here in Sept 2016 for 4-nights. This certainly is a very enjoyable facility with an impressive atrium, friendly staff, specious and clean rooms. The morning breakfast buffet is absolutely fabulous and delicious in both restaurants, pure vegetarian in the lobby or the regular one on 1st floor. Every member of the staff starting with the bell-boy to doormen to reception team have a very pleasant smile on their face to welcome and help you. It was a great surprise when the Chairman of the company stops at your breakfast table to greet you and chat with you to express his appreciation. This is a very classy place worth staying a few nights.

It is conveniently located next to Mumbai domestic airport, prices are more reasonable than some other high end hotels, staff are very friendly and attentive, rooms are good, food is excellent with accommodating chefs able to cater to every diet at a variety of restaurants, Indian buffet food is delicious, gym is compact but effective and rooftop pool refreshing. Water in taps and pool is purified by ozonolysis I believe so it is free of foul tasting chlorine and the hotel prides itself on environmental impact minimization. Wifi for 2 devices is free of charge and with functional bandwidth. I recommend the Orchid Hotel to everyone for great accommodation convenient to the airport but you might want to arrange a ""cool cab""

  When we arrived at the hotel we met Shaista (guest relations). What an impressive welcome. Shaista was very helpful and at the end of our stay we asked her to book a room on the way back (after 4 weeks of traveling through India). This is a big place with nice restaurants, an inviting swimming pool and very helpful room service. Good for an overnight stay if you want to be close to the airport.

  It was pure nostalgia returning to this iconic hotel after years. Nothing has changed - the decor, the capsule lifts, the hospitality, the breakfast buffet, all still delightfully impressive. It is most strategically located, almost walking distance of T1 terminal of the Mumbai airport. The hotel arranges complimentary pick up and drop to T1. Stay here whenever in Mumbai.

  ....it's glamorous and has a timeless old fashioned beauty, but shows some cracks here and there and some patina due to its age!  The architecture inside is grand and stately in a lavish, old fashioned style, like an ocean liner.  The rooms are lovely and homely, the service I found to be quite adequate; the rooftop terrace restaurant and pool is stunning after dark and the food there excellent, if rather expensive.  I adore it, and staying here makes me feel good - but it won't be to everyone's taste.  If you want modern, clean lines go to the Hyatt Regency (and pay double the price!), but I'll have this glamorous older lady any night!!!!

  We were here for a birthday celebration at Merlin's Karaoke Bar and had an amazing time.  This is a 4/5 star property very close to the domestic airport at Ville Parle, Mumbai. Entrance road is a bit awkward. But once in it's grand !  Lovely play with water done at the lobby. My kid had fun watching that and the elevators in the back drop  Good food and drinks. Amazing time with karaoke  Did not stay here so cannot comment on the rooms and other facilities. But seems a very good property to stay in.

  I am a regular here staying most of the times I visit Mumbai. The hotel is close to the airport and that makes it so much convenient for business travelers. This is a 4 star property though the hotel is described as a 5 star.   What I like about this property is that the rooms are good and the breakfast buffet is elaborate. The room service is also prompt.   What I don't like is that the food can be monotonous and boring for long staying guests. The aircon in some rooms make a lot of sound and can be disturbing at night. I am told that the air duct pressure in some rooms are high.  Overall one would not be disappointed with the Ecotel. It does have a roof top pool as well as a business center and a SPA.  Will be back. Do try to vary your food options during break fast.

The manager of the hotel introduced himself to some of our party present and made it very clear we were very welcome and insisted he would personally see that we were looked after. The breakfast buffet was superb and in lovely surroundings. The club lounge was welcoming and also the roof top terrace, swimming pool and restaurant, although the security guard presence a little forboding but not intrusive.

Whether it is the ride staff you encounter at the security check who dont even have the courtesy to take your bags and put them on the belt, or it is the bel staff who dont care to get the bags off the belt and inside the hotel.  On check in, you further encounter staff that are not interested in wishing you at all; they just stand there like machines out to get your details and hand over your key! Thats it!  Every review that has been posted on Tripadvisor speaks about the Rude staff at the hotel; however, the hotel management doesn't seem to care about it - 1 possible reason that it is always full.   The fact that it is always full is

For details regarding the aviation hobby I suggest visiting the website plane-spotting-hotels.com. Now the hotel. I arrived early (0930) in the morning. The first good thing was that they could give me my room straight away. I had room 535. The reception staff were great. The reception / lobby is almost palatial and imposing.

Dinner at MostlyGrill terrace restaurant was average. Goan Prawn curry did not seem authentic.Best part of the stay was great breakfast spread at Hotel Vindhyas and Boulevard.Taste of southindian food was delicious and followed by the short special tour by the owner himself Mr.Vithal.

Tushar was a very pleasant and efficient server. Great margarita! Slight downside was the time for check-in - so much paperwork! but done in a friendly fashion.

The check-in and check-out was also very smooth. The rooms are clean, roomy and are well kept. However, this is not a typical 5 star as the hotel is a bit old.   The best part of this hotel is the rooftop restaurant; a bit expensive but offers amazing views of the airport. The taxis are available right outside the hotel to go anywhere in Mumbai. There is also a midnight buffet which serves good food (specially desserts). Didnt have breakfast so cant comment on that.    For the price, this is an nice hotel though the internal seem to be in need of an overhaul. Overall, I was happy and will not mind staying again.

  When you are on a business trip in a city like mumbai you dnt spend too much time in a hotel.yet what you expect is a minimum level of hospitality and friendly staff to help you with little things. Sad that at this hotel you will get only proximity to domestic airport and nothing else. Fespite being a beautifully built hotel with all the neccessary aminities the warmth was missing from the staff. For all the requests or wueries the first answer was a No...not eve let me try. Even the morning or evening greetings was missing.staff looked too occipied in their own personal talks. I with my collegue stayed there for about 4-5 days but never found a smiling staff...may be they were too stressed to even acknowldege your greetings. Just short of rude behaviour even at breakfast buffet

  We booked three nights here last minute, assuming it would be a good hotel (since it is a 5 star hotel). However, for those who are looking for a luxurious experience and modern ambience - this isn't really the place to be. It is not really  comparable with some of the hotels in Juhu. They also seem to host a lot of local business conferences etc. We ended up leaving after one night since the music was too loud. I guess it is a nice place for those who just want to have a good hotel to sleep and nice breakfast.

I got a call from them inviting me to attend a celebration on the rooftop (festival to celebrate the end of crops in north india), and it was amazing. They hired dancers/musicians and we all danced and had an amazing time.  I had dinner in my room and it was very tasty and reasonably priced.

There were also some unauthorised room service charges to our bill, though when asked to see the receipt of this, one could not be provided and the charges were dropped (15 minutes wasted). We told the staff about the problems with the rooms and she rudely and loudly told us that it wasn't her fault.

The doormen were also extremely helpful since this was peak monsoon and they didn't let a drop touch me.

  Booked this hotel from New York for 2 nights for my sister in India. The hotel can't accept international credit cards without filling up a manual form!! I've booked JW Marriot (Mumbai &amp; Dehi) &amp; the Lalit, Delhi on numerous occasions for locals in India, they have no problem accepting international credit cards. On top of that they refused to accept Debit Cards (??) and the fellow at the front desk had the cheek to ask for cash payment for the room - given all the demonetisation related cash access issues in India! What kind of archaic systems does this hotel have??? I question if it is a 5-star property. Oh, and the reservations desk hangs up on you if you start questioning their archaic policy -- talk about poor customer service.

  I absolutely would NOT recommend this hotel.  There were so many problems.  I actually used budget accommodation for the majority of my stay in Mumbai, which was a far more pleasant experience than this hotel.    The staff were so rude to me and my friend; for a start, they mixed up our booking, and threatened to eject us from the hotel unless we paid an extra 1500 Rupees.    The security treat women like prisoners, this is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.  The receptionist also seemed to have a problem with female customers: being rude, grabbing her mobile phone out of her hands, and talking to her like an animal are not acceptable ways of dealing with any customers; additionally speaking purposefully unclearly, and detaining her at reception while I am in the room,

Next morning we went to their other restaurant ""Vindhyas"" - here the breakfast is served on the table. We really appreciated the serving portions - it is just enough for one person so he can try other dish. They have nearly 56 dishes on the list and they serve it in a plate lined by banana leaf. It was a pure vegetarian fare and was tasty. We recommend one should try this restaurant for their complimentary breakfast when they stay at this hotel. The only thing

  The Orchid has the advantage of its proximity to the airport, so even in the worst of Mumbai traffic, it takes no more than 30 mins to and fro the airport. To everywhere else though, it'll take some time during peak hours. Generally, everyone was polite, greeted me and my group with smiles and very helpful and attentive to our needs and requests.  However I was given different information for the same requests twice. The day I checked out I asked if it was possible to do a half day extension check out as my flight was only at night  I was told, that a full day's fee would be applicable. A colleague of mine had asked the same thing at another counter and was told that half day fee was ok.  So be sure to check properly if you need this sort of thing. The rooms were spacious

  Stayed at The Orchid Mumbai to attend a wedding reception held at the hotel. The hotel was busy as usual with a crowd at the Front Desk area. There was no greeting or welcome from the reception staff while check-in, probably due to the busyness around them. So was a very average and bland check-in. However, the bell staff were very courteous and kind despite of being swarmed with chaos around them.  The room given to us was an executive room. The room had a split level, with the sitting area as you enter and the bed on the lower level seperated by a partition.  Room was clean, however looked a bit run down and in dire need of a renovation. The bed mattress was also quite hard.   The bathroom also requires serious upgrading. All the bathroom fittings were stained and oxidised.

It was against their own well laid out policies. Matter got resolved over telephonic conversation but was unexpected.

  I am a regular at the Orchid and have been using it since 2001. Unfortunately royalty is not accorded the weight that it should be by the Orchid. The sales team is fairly uncoordinated and offer different rates for a booking for which a conversation was happening over a month. During peak season the rates get exhorbitant and being a loyal/repeat guest has no bearing whatsoever.  However the Banquets team - as always - is very helpful and very professional and is the reason why I keep going back to The Orchid. Also,  it was a pleasure to meet Mr Kamat during my last visit.

Each person was exactly doing what they need to do. The ambiance and smell were likable and comfort felt right from entrance.

  Ended up staying here because most of the other hotels were fully booked for some exhibition. Room is decent, but doesn't feel 5 star (that's what they claim), maybe because it's getting old.

Most Indian hotels I have stayed at offer this for free (and would certainly also expect this from a 5-star hotel). Further to this they forgot to pick me up in the airport.. I have stayed at both Meluha and Renaissance before and this is definitely where I will also go again the next time... I can 100% guarantee that I will never go there again.

  My wife and I spent two nights here before flying off to the tiger reserves in Central India. The hotel is extremely comfortable and clean, The staff are very polite and friendly, and the food in the restaurant is very good also, offering Indian and Continental choices. There are Wi-Fi facilities. Swimming pool on the roof terrace. It is extremely convenient for getting to and from the airport......approx. 10 minutes from the international terminal and 5 minutes from the domestic, We had a very pleasant stay, and would recommend a visit.

  We have been been conducting programs at The Orchid since 2 years and their service has been consistently warm, supportive and exceptional. Every person of the staff from A-Z has been very helpful, warm and a pleasure to interact with. The Orchid has become like our second home due to great relationships they have been able to forge with us. Congratulations on the great work to the whole Orchid Team, Special thanks to Shanti (Business Desk) and Vineet (Banquets) who have been top notch in their service.  Love you guys!

  The communal areas of this hotel are impressive - the dining facilities, on the first floor and the roof - certainly the roof has some very impressive reasonably priced meals and the often personal attention of the chef in residence. The lobby area is also chic and a half - but the drinks are the most expensive I've ever experienced anywhere in the world eg at the happy hour on the roof you get one free beer for every two purchased but at £10 a pint it's a little OTT especially for a local beer.  The rooms were adequate though they were both dated and tired - suites were stained and windows dirty (outside). Service was on the whole pretty good - so a positive outcome - trains to downtown Mumbai were just a short tuck tuck ride away and regular, plentiful and cheap as chips.

  I had gone wid my friend's fr brunch the food nd ambience was good but the discounts on the brunch that i use to get earlier as a member of the hotel is no more so it becums expensive to go there which is very bad and the discount vouchers are also not applicable for the sunday brunch its only valid from monday to saturday so its very expensive and not worth going there and the crowd is also become less than it use to be earlier. My suggestion is they should start giving more discounts for the sunday brunch.

  This hotel is located close to the Mumbai domestic airport, and therefore convenient for travelers arriving late and/or departing early by air. The hotel has a complimentary pick-up and drop arrangement from/to the domestic airport, which is of great help.  The room I stayed in was dark and gloomy, and the reception could not entertain my request to change the room. The breakfast and dinner buffets had adequate options, but the service in the restaurant could have been better.   The USP of this hotel is a museum located on the 1st floor, with the theme “Mother”. It is a wonderful museum (open during daytime only) having household artifacts used by ladies in India through the ages. The collection (and the display) is very nice, and worth viewing. Hope the photographs attached

  This is a nice place, and very near the airport. It also happens to be near relatives, too. We were greeted and instantly offered a room upgrade. We had already secured a very nice rate through Expedia, so this was a nice surprise. The room was huge and the bathroom was very nice--lots of water pressure and both a hand-held shower and and overhead rainshower type thing. There are nice restaurants inside, which is very handy. There were a few glitches (our room had a power issue at one point) but any issues were promptly handled. I don't really have anything negative to say, except that I witnessed the guards try to stop a woman from taking in a Subway sandwich. Though I was happy to eat in the hotel's restaurants, I don't think that a hotel should be allowed to block someone

  The Orchid was a a delightful experience for me. With courteous staff welcoming to easy checkin, everything was smooth and serene.  Clean linen and hygienic bathrooms were just awesome.  Though I didn't had time to explore the rooftop pool, I had enough time to relish the buffet breakfast laid out in a lavish sitting. The coffee wasn't that great, it can be improved in the way it is served especially to those who prefer milk coffee/tea.  The mini bar has some aerated drinks, but charged at a very high cost, thus one can avoid having it, if possible.  In room dining menu is good, the food I ordered was good, both in terms of taste and quantity.

  The orchid's trump card is probably its location which is right next to the domestic airport. However, with 3 major carriers now operating from the international terminal, this may not hold. Especially since they dont provide the complimentary pick up - drop to the international terminal.  the hotel itself is nice, but looks dated compared to its competitors. The plus side of that is its very spacious. The rooms are large and give you ample space to move around. I would prefer a more modern looking hotel though. The passageways are dimly lit and have serious lack of sunlight.  The breakfast buffet is par for the course, though nothing exceptional to write about. At the price point, there are better options to be had.

  what a beautiful hotel, way above my expectations, very large rooms and bathroom, super friendly and helpful staff, just stunning, highly recommend this hotel, all the staff were lovely, the buffet breakfast was great, so much to choose from, 2km from train station &amp; close to airport,  i was a little disappointed in the ""extra"" charges when i went to fix up my bill for room service that were not expected, but apart from being more carful next time i go, i would defiantly stay here again

  The coffe shop Boulevard at the Orchid was surprisingly good, spread was awesome, taste was nice and price..well fantastic as compared fo all other brunches.  Taste: they had a decent spread of salads and hot non veg and veg starters. Taste of all them was nice. Desert spread was damng good at least a dozen varieties of pastries Indian sweets and cookies  The main course spread in veg and non veg was awesome and almost all of it was great!  Price : the menu is priced at 1850 plus taxes Including a free swim at their pool.   TIP: if you book the table a day earlier then they give an early bird discount of 25%!! So the buffet becomes very value for money.  The only issue is that the coffee shop is a bit small and the buffet is cramped up in one place . Otherwise all good.

  I stayed in this hotel for the first time although I visited this hotel several times earlier to have food in their different restaurants. Front desk person Mr. Felix made the check-in smooth and informed me that he upgraded my room. This is a hotel located very close to Domestic airport Mumbai and also close to International airport.This is a big property and a very busy hotel but very peaceful. This is a Eco friendly hotel as it says. They have free pick up and drop only for domestic airport. For transfer to international airport they charge INR 952 ( including tax per way)  The food is just ok . I had both buffet breakfast and dinner at Boulevard but found food just OK. Restaurant on roof top is very good.  Rooms are good but old. It needs renovation/upgradation. Bathroom too

Mr. Rajeev, Nirmala, Tushar, Karishma and all staff at The Vindhyas made my experience even better. One suggestion i have for them is that, they should keep the timings of the Souvenir Shop and Aai Museum Flexible so that tourists can visit them.

  Well where do I begin. Since my last review of this property, things have changed around here. In a very good way that is. All the negative points in my last review were actually taken care of, plus much more. This time me and my girlfriend visited this place on our 7th year anniversary plus my birthday, and Mr Sahani is such a gentleman he sent us a crazyyy delicious cake from their gourmet cake shop. I could notice the staff were extra attentive towards each and every need of our's, be it small or big. The in room dining staff asked me how did i find the ""corn palak"" sabzi coz I mentioned it to him earlier while ordering that that's one of my favorite. I was amazed that he remembered such a little information. Things like these that makes this place our home away from home.

  Let’s start from the beginning. Check-in takes much longer than expected. You are given your room card and asked to go to the room on your own- there’s no one who will come and escort you to your room. Not sure what the no. of people who greet you at the reception are for.  Ok so now you go to the room, which is decently-sized and appears comfortable. The only hitch is that it smells mouldy, which you get used to but definitely neither pleasant nor good for your lungs.  The in-room service is terrible. It takes a long time to place an order, especially since the contact person is not aware of options available in the in-room service menu. Once he’s convinced of the options available and the order is taken, you will (at least I did) a call asking how the payment will be done.

  I stayed here for a night and first the positives: 1. It is walking distance from domestic arrival ( terminal 1) 2. Vindhyas ( one of their restaurants) serves perhaps one of the best South Indian breakfast in the country  3. The bar has a nice karaoke in the evenings which can be fun  Now the things that don't work well:  1. The rooms wear a jaded look and are very ordinary  2. The gym was so tough to find that we took 10 minutes to reach - was small and not star standard 3. The service isn't great - we were asked to pay for tea in the room in cash - a first for me - they wouldn't post the bill to the room for some reason 3. Check out took over 20 minutes  4. Overall a poor value for money

As I write the review, we are planning to have dinner at Mostly Grills, the restaurant which is on their rooftop against the background of the airport runway where my kids are surely gonna enjoy the take offs and landing of aeroplanes.  I must make a mention of the housekeeping over here who are very, very swift and helpful. Whenever we request for anything, we receive the same within minutes. Not only that, each time we request for anything, there's always a telephone call from them to check whether the requested item is indeed delivered.

  I first stayed at the Orchid back in 2009. It used to be a nice property.  Ever since, the hotel has been expanded. It's bigger and busier.  But sadly, not better!  Over the the years, the standards of service and quality of rooms, linen, dining and facilities has gone steadily downhill. It has reached a stage where I actually feel cheated whenever I am forced to check in to this hotel.  My experience this time is typical.   The check in experience is torturous. I was the only person checking in, yet the process took 15 minutes which included fumbling with credit cards, confusion over smoking/non-smoking rooms and insistence that I block ""at least"" INR 20,000/-   Then the room - musty smell, damp towels, virtually no toilet paper and a flush that refuses to stop flushing ----

You must really be carefull when they ask your credit card: it is a common esperience that they steal money from it saying that they are just cheking it.

Odd and unpleasant experience coming back in from Chill's Restaurant today.  Had my take away dish confiscated at the entry, and told I was not allowed to bring in food from outside.  Some lame excuse of "" food of unknown safety "" was given.  Obviously an effort to insist you spend your food budget in their poorly operated restaurant.  Spent my last day in this chain.

I got a great deal online and the room was clean, comfortable and functional. Can't comment on anything else, but good value for money and very convenient to both airports (walking distance or über to domestic airport) and short uber to the international.  Service was very good and although wifi was free, it didn't work for me and too late in the evening at check in for tech support.   It's not a high-end option and don't expect it, but didn't disappoint for the reasons of choice. Would stay again if I had an early flight. If you don't know Mumbai traffic; it's something to behold, so the closer the better!

Service comes with a smile n is very personalised.Every care is taken to make your stay comfortable n enjoyable.It is one of the few hotels which give u a free pick up n drop from the airport.They even gave me an upgrade even without my asking. The rooms are clean n well laid out.The only thing that may need an improvement is on the lighting in the room.For me it was a trifle dim  The breakfast spread is very sumptuous n beautifully laid out.However,it being a South Indian hotel the Idlis could be softer n smoother.

The view from my room was not good. but sleep was calm and must say very nice service of House Keeping staff.  14th we had Breakfast at Ground Floor South Indian Restaurant, quality of Food n service was awesome.....The chairman of the Hotel was sitting next to our Table and met us while leaving and asked how was the food n then he gave his introduction, which was intellectual way of taking actual reviews......... On 15th had BF at 1st Floor which was not easy to find if will go directly from the rooms so must go to Lobby first then you can get there easily....... Thanks for the lovely food n stay.....

  I hadn't been for a stay here, but since it was my son's naming ceremony, we had booked a banquet hall on the ground floor. Everything from start to finish was excellently managed. The entrance is majestic, grand and spacious and a fountain to woo the guests. The banquet hall was classy too, the service, the starters, the food - you name it. It certainly made the occasion a hit, all thanks to the quality of The Orchid.

  I had booked this hotel because a good offer was going on and I wanted to experience an Ecotel Hotel. I had tried a lot of times before, but unfortunately was never able to find the time or get a good offer to convince me to book. The check-in was smooth, and I was upgraded to the Club Room with a decent view of the Runway. The room had a mini-bar which was slightly over-priced. The rooms were spacious, because it was a Club Room. For dinner we had gone to the Rooftop Restaurant which was named ""Mostly Grills"". The chef came and personally greeted us, made us feel comfortable and gave his recomendation which we went with.  From where we were seated, we got a bird eye's view of the runway. The breakfast spread was vast, and I was really impressed with the attention to detail.

  This is very close to the domestic airport . The rates are reasonable and the property has all amenities you expect from a business hotel . However the service left much to be desired and the all day dining  restaurant wouldn't serve A la Carte as they had only buffet in the afternoon ... !!! The breakfast spread in the buffet was good as were the room amenities.However the corridors are dimly lit and create a very dreary ambiance.   Check out took inordinately long with several other guests  also waiting similarly for service. All in all would only rate as average ,

  This place must have really been something 30 years ago, but I don't think it has been cleaned or anything fixed since it was built.  The pace was dirty and the bed was the worst I have ever slept on. I would have been much more comfortable in a sleeping bag and a thermorest air mattress.  The gym was made up of broken down gear. When I got the bike (that was missing foot straps) over 90 RPM it would loose resistance causing my feet to slip off the pedals and then slapping me in the leg.  The only reason they get two stars is because the restaurant wasn't bad.  Avoid this place.

  The best part of this hotel is it's proximate on to the T1 terminal of Mumbai airport - so, if you're flying any of the airlines that fly from T1, this hotel is walking distance from the terminal. This is a old hotel and has not been modernised yet. Lots of wood in all the fixtures make this look very old. The Maintainance is OK, but you can make out that the age of the fixtures shows the real picture. The food is expensive, but good in taste. The breakfast spread is elaborate.

  I have had nothing but problems since we checked into the hotel. My  children were given a room that had an air-conditioning unit that leaked.  We asked them to fix the problem after the first day. My children had to stay there another evening even though the floor was soaking wet. Atul was notified of the problem as I took him to room 615 to show him the living conditions that my children were subjected to. Atul moved the children to room 616.  One evening I came here with a few pieces of leftover pizza from Domino's and was told that I was not allowed to bring food into the hotel.  This of course wasn't done by an employee but done by a security guard who refused to allow me to enter the hotel. I asked to speak to Atul and instead Ajeet came out and said no food is allowed in

  The hotel is bang next to the airport behind Sahara Star and excellent for an overnight stopover between flights. Very compact and well laid out- It looks a tad renovated because it probably was- the fittings are very antique yet aesthetic and the hotel guest floor passages exude an old world charm. They have a south indian restaurant Vindhyas on the ground floor and a 24 hours coffee shop Boulevard which is a delight for its midnight buffet and eats. Didn't visit the rooftop where they have a kebabry and grilled stuff I suppose. The staff is highly courteous and friendly. Would definitely repeat.

  The hotel is very close to the airport. What catches your first attention is that its a huge property with lots of staff. You will find loads of staff waiting to help you in the lobby but not enough counters or staff for check in and check out and you will have to wait for some time to get your turn. In my case, even the room was not ready though I checked in after 12 noon. The rooms are comfortable and you will get all necessary amenities in the room. The complimentary breakfast spread is lavish and you will be spoilt for choices. Stayed for couple of nights and overall it was a good stay. Only problem is the internet was not working for multiple devices, which is an issue.

One breakfast meal is complimentary per room per person i think which is nice. Their midnight buffet is good.

  This is a standard, decent property with a great location and warm, attentive staff. However the whole point of staying at Orchid is the location....literally a hundred meters from the airport. They have complimentary transfers for domestic flights however now that major domestic airlines have moved to T2, one would expect that they would extend this courtesy there too. But they charge instead a hefty 950 Rs for a 1 km ride which I consider a complete ripoff and will certainly make me reconsider staying here again.

  Its my second stay at the hotel for business and I'm quite satisfied with the service offered. Good service from employees, good room and efficient restaurant operation.i would recommend the roof top restaurant with their range ok kebabs- mostly grill restaurant. Ask for Tushar, you will get the best service but all are nice. If there one thing which needs quick upgrade it is the wifi system. What a pain.... You need to log in every day on the one and only device with free access. Who has only 1 device today.... Fix the it and more people will come and return

  This hotel looks great on the website but the pictures must have been taken 10 years ago. It is tired and dated. The rooms are drab and the bathrooms miserable. The overall cleanliness is questionable, even the elevators are dull. The location is awful, you cannot leave the hotel unless you are in a cab, there is nothing nearby to do. Avoid at all costs.

  A nice place to stay. Lives up to the expectation. If you have a craving for the mid nite munchies you can always try the mid night buffet here. The rooms are neat and tidy, although it does seem a bit outdated. All in all a great place to stay. The proximity to the airports is an added benefit.

  Hotel is situated within 5 minutes distance from Mumbai domestic airport which automatically saves lots of time of yours as mumbai is very much known for its traffic. The best for people travelling for business purposes. Buffet offers you a wide variety of foods and hotel has a beautiful interior decor. Rooms are a little old fashioned and pretty much small. As the name suggests the hotel is pretty much decorated with orchids around. Hotel ambience is not that great but if you are lucky enough, you may find one or two celebrities dining next to you in the buffet.

  I had booked this place for the weekend 4th June 2016, thinking it was a 5 star but its a hopeless hotel. The room they provide when you book through travel sites like Makemytrip etc, are in the old wing, which is in such a delipidated state, 2 star lodges might have better rooms, The Switches and sockets in the rooms weren't working, we had to use our powerbanks to charge our phones, luckily it was just a night stay for us. The rooms look so old and in desperate need of repairs the covers on the switch boxes were falling off. When i spoke to the housekeeping staff, they said it will take really long but didn't offer to do anything about it. The passage was also so dark and Gloomy, infact even the lifts are really tiny and those buttons are also really hard to press. The hotel

Ajeet helped us throughout our stay with the warm smile and courteous gesture. Same as checkout too was swift and prompt.

  The part about the Orchid is its proximity to the airport... which is just walking distance which is great if you are one of those who never reaches the airport on time.  The rooms were spacious and had all the amenities one expects from a 5 star nowadays.  The breakfast spread one of the best I have seen with a variety of meats, bakery items and veg specialities.. including the popular Jalebi Fafda. Also loved the egg options which were very tasty and exotic.  The rooftop bar is good and offers a good view of the airport.  What's lacking is good front office coordination for reservations and the speed with which the handle the check in process which was very slow.. also their insistence on payment formalities during checkin.   Overall a good stay with good food to go.

  The first impression was itself depressing- overcrowded lobby, which was damp and smelly. It continued with the lifts, which were smelly and looked poorly maintained (the buttons, the interior, etc) and the room itself. The carpets were dirty, the room stank of pesticide/insecticide, the lounge/ seat upholstery were dirty and dusty and the bathroom fittings and interior not worthy of even a 3 star hotel. The only redeeming feature was the restaurant Vindhya, where we had a nice dinner on one of the nights. Would not recommend it to anyone. Better stay at the Marriott or one of the other hotels near the airport. This place is a rip off in many ways- a one way transfer to the international (T2) terminal, only a stones' throw away was Rs950 (using their cab), whereas we used an air

  We arrived as a group of six and stayed at the Orchid in Mumbai for only one night.  We told the hotel we were a group of six but only a solo driver turned up with one car for six people with luggage!  Another driver was quickly arranged but this wasn't a great start to our stay.  Also the driver had our flight details but was absent when we arrived as he was waiting at the wrong gate for us!

  The hotel is adjacent to the domestic airport terminal and only 15 mins from the International terminal , so for an overnight stay it is practical, but a bit far out of town if you want to visit the city.It is misleading to say it is in walking distance from the domestic terminal , we tried to walk it , but there are too many roads to cross and no indication as to which direction is the hotel , take a rickshaw or taxi. Orchid Hotel Mumbai is in the city centre, close to corporate offices of Citibank, IBM, Infotech companies, diamond industry, located in Bandra-kurla, MIDC, SEEPZ and Andheri-kurla. The Orchid is just 15km from the old business district of Nariman Point, Colaba, Fort etc, which houses govt. institutions, UN bodies and other financial institutions like The Reserve

I must confess that the services provided by bearer Mr. Venice Gonsalvis were so excellent that I felt like I am at home. The preparations made by Chef Sandeep were mouth watering and very very tasty. The biggest surprise was that Venice kept on requesting for the portions on his own and chef Sandeep made those preparations more and more tasty. I have to wish both of them Best of Luck.

  This hotel has a dual personality. You will encounter some bad things, and when u are about to label this hotel as ""worst place to stay"" suddenly something very nice happens.

First the negatives -lack of staff to assist you with your baggage -I dint see any luggage trolleys or anyone using them. -I got a feeling that some hotel staff judge you, making you uncomfortable. -one room service guy just opened the door and walked in, instead of knocking first. -while the bathroom was nice, the bathtub couldn't hold the water even after the  drain was closed.

A guy knocks our door at 12:05 AM when we were tired and asleep and guess what a surprise we have? An apple :) They are crazy to send Apples to you at midnight. It doesn't matter if you are tired and deep asleep.   3. The old look, not a good one.   4. They give you free wifi which is good but the best part is the wifi doesn't work at all.

My experience with politeness started from there on - the chauffeur &amp; the bell desk. The check in was not very smooth - the lady was not speaking up and I was tired - not a great combination.  The hotel definitely needs a facelift - the room was ok. But the lobby had a run down look - stained sofas, old facade etc. You just don't expect this from a five star hotel!!  A fantastic roof top restaurant - lovely food and great staff. Great wifi throughout the hotel which was a boon.  A word to the bell desk staff - you guys need better trolleys to manage the luggage or you will end up with a ruined and broken back. Its not just  being certified Eco friendly, but Safe

  The hotel on the surface looks great. It has a large foyer and has the makings of a 5 star hotel. The rooms are also spacious.  But the sheets are worn and poor quality,  The check in service is very slow and less than courteous. Check out was also extemely tardy and took over fifteen minutes. Too long  for just a one night stay which was prepaid. It seems that there is a lack of service training.  The rooftop restaurant was overpriced and also the food was on par with pub food, again the service here was tardy and unfriendly. The downstairs cocktail bar, though did have a good atmosphere.

  hi friends , i had been here for a free stay provided to me by the purchase of orchid gold membership. This place has a very good room and its very clean.The food provided in the room service is too expensive and is not worth the value and taste as i ordered a chicken fried rice , which was horrible and it was priced extensively high. the food in the restaurants is tasty but then its more expensive than room service. The hotel organizes karaoke in the bar, thats a good thing for entertainment , one more good thing is that the hotel provides discount on its cakes after 6 pm thats worth a bite. They should pay attention to the prices and the prices should be worth of the food served to the customer.

We received constant calls and visits asking about making up the room, if we wanted dinner at their restaurant, bringing a fruit basket. While it was all well-intentioned, it was a bit much when we were just looking for a place to rest and get a shower before our flight.  A plus is that the hotel is only 15 minutes from the airport, so no worries about getting caught in crazy traffic.

The worse was that the WC in our washroom (Room no. 553) had a continuous leak. The management should get that repaired quickly. The service staff was warm and took good care of us, we also enjoyed the pool on rooftop and the facilities at the fitness center.

  I stayed in the hotel for a weekend offer ( 2 club rooms) with my entire family. The rooms were average compared to other five star hotels. Staff were polite to me and my wife, and also wished us greetings when ever we cross them but did not acknowledge my parent since they don't look polished as me or my wife. When ever my parents came to restaurant or lobby,the staff simply looked at them like some servants who tagged along with us. My parents dress simple without much fuss as they prefer it. Since they were uncomfortable in the hotel we spent most of the time outside or inside the room. During check out, when my two sons were playing in the lobby running around some fountain which was way high for them to dip their hands in water.They were warned harshly by bell boy and

  As a person who has stayed in most 5 star hotels surrounding the airport this has got to be the worst. It smells, feels old and nothing works.  I arrived from a 15 hour trip to come to a hotel that didn't allow me to bring in a sandwich I had purchased because outside food isn't allowed. Then the wifi didn't work, I called the front desk 3 times who said repeatedly they'd send a technician, the 4th call the phone stopped working, it took an hour to get basic slow wifi setup, they charged 900 rupees to get fast wifi, the next morning I left for a meeting and came back to a messy room that hadn't been made and my room service wasn't cleared, the door to my room wouldn't work I had to ask house keeping to manually open it with a key, when I spoke to the manager he took no

  The location is convenient to the two Mumbai airports.  We had enjoyed our stay at this hotel several years ago so chose this hotel again.  The main attraction was the small but adequately functional gym.  The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom had amenities as well.  The hotel advertises free shuttle service to the airport.  However, this service is limited only to the domestic airport and they will charge you 950 rupees (15 US dollars) from the international airport.  Uber will take you there for about 3 US dollars.

  I really enjoyed my stay at the Orchid, and found the staff to be engaging and helpful. My room was very modern (probably recently renovated) and very comfortable. There was a mild odour of mildew from the a/c, and the room felt humid to the extent that even the sheets and papers felt damp (in early March - not monsoon!). As it turns out, the a/c was being renovated during my stay so hopefully that issue will have been addressed in the meantime. Although my room overlooked the Domestic Airport, I didn't hear anything from outside - perfect for a good sleep! Don't miss the chance to eat at South of Vindhyas - the food and service are superb.

  A five star, within a stones throw away distance from Mumbai Airport, at a price of 87 USD (6000 INR) per night ? What can be wrong with such a hotel ? Well the check in makes you feel stupid, as it is managed by un-trained young lads who are less than smiling to welcome you. You walk into the elevator, you start getting that jaded feel. You enter the room, and they are small, and the linens are not crisp. This is an eco-friendly hotel, but, but, but, re-used disposable slippers ?  Sad. The washrooms are chipped at places and again you get that old feel when there is a gurgling noise out of the wash basin with the water draining. This used to be a good old eco sensitive five star hotel, but today its reduced to a sad old edifice. Guys, please this place needs serious renovation.

  Orchid never ceases to disappoint. This was our third time staying at Orchid. The hotel is absolutely lovely with great service and amenities.  The rooms are clean and comfortable. There are plenty of food options within the hotel. Although a bit on the pricier side the food is amazing!   If you can get access to the Club level, I recommend that as well as you will have private/extended hours for breakfast and snacks throughout the day.   Hatss of boulevard staff.

  We had a pleasant stay at this hotel. It is suppose to be a five star property but it is not in the same league as Taj, ITC or Leela but they try their best. It is located by the domestic airport therefore, it is very convenient.  The staff especially their duty manager were up to the job. Their roof top restaurant is excellent for service and food. There were issues with wifi and other small matters. They can supply bigger soap bars. This is more a four star then a five star but our stay was pleasant.

  The hotel was good. I was with m family for a business trip. And one was added to our trip and was helpful to advise me on how to rebook without anuly hassle. Thanks to Felix, who have assisted me without wasting my time with my family and kids. He has handled it very proficiently.  A good hotel to suggest.  However I must say the WiFi options in the room were not that standard as expected.  It was charged and limited to two users only.... otherwise it's a worth experience visiting The Orchid Hotel, Mumbai.

I had tried certain new dishes that day and we're mouth watering.can try on any day. I stayed here for 2 nights.

  Stayed there for one night last month. Deal offered by MMT was value for money for the hotel. Clean &amp; great place near airport. The rooms are good with space. You can breath. I had a room with window opening in the inside shaft (u cud jum to eat). We had to ensure drapes were always on when dressing... I guess that is how portal room bookings r treated (direct booking cud hv been different ?)  I have found the fixed menu price in these hotels are quite steep. It would be helpful to have a meal with taxes around 800 Rs. If restaruantweek India can offer such prices in same class of hotels, why not offer this to hotel guests with limited requirement. This may improve F&amp;B billing ??  Overall great experience. Will return if MMT keep offering such prices..

  I could try to share my experience in detail but it would seem that terms and conditions under which I am supposed to write this review won't allow it.  So I would be to the point:  Pros: Rooms - Spacious and comfortable  Cons: - No free wifi (it is a standard for a 5 star accommodation today) - King size beds in rooms available on demand - Non-cooperative staff  - Policies for payment (100% advance if you do not have a master/visa credit card which is, if I might say, against the law!) - No value for money - Tumultuousness ensures compliance by staff while gentle requests may fall on deaf ears.  There are plenty of hotels available in Mumbai which could offer much more for the price you would be paying to stay at the Orchid.  Whether to stay at this hotel or not is a choice

  This was my first stay at the Orchid, although I had eaten there before. The biggest advantage of this property is its location, right around the corner from Mumbai’s domestic airport. Otherwise, it’s average, and definitely overpriced for what you get.   My favorite part of my stay was the breakfast buffet. Though there were not as many food selections as you find at some other hotels, there were some unusual dishes such as baked eggs with parsley and blueberry danish pastry. Another plus is that there is plenty of hot water on tap in the bathroom, and you don’t have to wait for the pipes to heat up. The starters at the dinner event I attended were quite good, as well.   My least favorite feature was the hotel’s fitness center, a small room on the sixth floor. The low ceiling

Was sweetly told to go fend for myself (after landing at Mumbai Airport) at 8 PM without even the courtesy of arranging a cab and alternate stay. Net Experience: Stay at your own risk (VFM: Horrible, but courteous staff with their hands tied together beyond their control).   Being a 5 day- a- week International Business traveler who stays in Business Class and 5 Star hotels, this kind of behavior is unacceptable to anyone and a hazard to any Business or Leisure Traveler

Although it is the usual big, multi-purpose airport hotel, its staff was exceptionally helpful - starting with the charming Subhash who welcomed me and helped facilitate an early check-in. Later, he was able to repair my shoes which looked unable to make it home. Due to major snow storms in US cities where I was trying to fly, I needed to use hotel computers and the travel desk. All were extra helpful, even calling me to follow up. Shanti and a very helpful young man in the Business Center gave close attention to the situation until it was resolved.

The hotel ambiance is good if you look at it from the lens of early 2000. The hotel is maintained well. The rooms are moderate in size. The A/C sometimes makes you feel that it is not giving you enough cooling.  The best part of this hotel is the morning breakfast on the 1st level. There are good enough options.

One of the lousiest hotels in Mumbai, terrible experience all the time, they don't know customer delight despite being in servicing industry.  Despite having a pre-paid voucher which mentions inclusions of breakfast and wi-fi one has to go through same debate with front desk all the time, thats the only thing consistent in this hotel.  Two people see the same monitor and communicate different things to customers.  Bathrooms have no toiletries most of the times and showers have water running as if there is drought in Mumbai city.

  When we entered the hotel, the receptionist had no respect for their guest at all but we had already paid online so we were stuck and had to deal with the attitude. After tolerating the rude staff we were very disappointed to see the rooms as well. The carpets were old and worn out, the beds and the headboards were extremely dirty and the toilet was extremely nasty.  We went to complain to the manager and he said that they would clean the rooms. The staff came in and sprayed a little air freshner and within 5 seconds they were gone. After the depressing night the breakfast was terrible and the cutlery including the tissues were dirty on the table. We were extremely happy after checking out and leaving that place and that we didn't have to stay for longer.

  It's very unfair to say this is a 5star category.You can find better rooms in 3star hotels rather.there is not ample amount of light in the room after switching on all lights its still shabby. Place very untidy .property very much unmaintained. And definitely it's a fraud to say this place a 5star hotel.sorry but had paid in advance so have to bear the place .

  It was a transit stay in Mumbai on 22 Jan 2016 primarily for catching early morning flight from Mumbai. It was a short stay from 10 pm to 6 am and hence, I did not have food or use any other facilities. However, room was good and excellent value for money especially if you are looking for something close to the hotel. Entrance is slightly crampy given that it is almost in the Airport periphery in Mumbai but airport drop vehicle cleanliness and quality and speed of service (primarily wake up call, etc) was great. Strongly recommended especially if location suits you.

  We visit Mumbai 2-3 times a year and usually stay at The Lalit or Hilton near the Airport.  We though we would try a different 5 star hotel this time and chose Orchid as it seemed relatively cheaper - boy you know why its cheaper.  A 5 start Hotel? - not really sure.  The service is definitely 2-3 star.  Every little thing you want has an extra charge - event Wi-Fi in communal areas which is free at most 5 star hotels around the world is chargeable - the first words that come out of staff mouth is 'it is chargeable'  At breakfast, the service was simply rubbish - the sort you get in 2-3 star hotels.  We say at a table and went to get some buffet food.  When we returned, someone had taken our table and moved our stuff - this happened 3 times during breakfast and staff seemed

  Had a forced halt due to flight disruption. The hotel front desk manages us , the weary travelers, who were stranded at the airport for nine hours with a smile and professionalism. The check-in was a little bit chaotic as we did not have our boarding passes and they required a confirmation from the airline. The room was well appointed and the beds had a good sleep quality. The bathrooms though compact are more than sufficient for an individual to use. The Buffet meals  spread was satisfactory and tasty. Could not explore much as we were travel weary and worried about our cancelled flights fresh .departure. The staff was very helpful.

  Upfront this is a hotel that does not merit the cost one pays for a room night. The only advantage being it opposite the airport. Period!! The rooms are dowdy and old and the mattresses lumpy and uncomfortable.  The fromt office staff especially come across as rude and arrogant. They malign the hotel industry by generalizing their hotel's policies as common business practices. Example being charging a credit card pre-auth for corporate bookings.   Comes across as a chain that generally does not trust their customers.   My recommendation- skip this place. You will find better options in this area which will treat you much better and value your business

  Quite a bad experience with bad room. The stuff didn't care when the issue was raised either.  The overall experience was 3-star but with five-star pricing. Staff didn't seem to be trained except for the South Indian restaurant. The beak fast at the South Indian place was awesome and helped us to feel a little comfortable during our stay, otherwise not recommended if you are expecting a 5-star rated stay.   One exceptional point of the hotel is the proximity to the domestic airport and free transfers.

The hotel staff was really nice and helpful with prompt service. In room dining and the restaurant food was quite good. The only area where they could have done a little better was the quality of the bed. Though not bad, I would expect more from a 5 star.   All-in-all a very good budget 5 star hotel for a short stay in the city.

  I spent a night in this hotel after booking it through hotels.com. No advance payment was required, and I had no problems either.  What I liked about this place is that barring the Fitness Center, the room, the amenities, the service was all top class. I called the Reception, House-Keeping and Room Service and each and every time the phone was answered at the first ring!   Services were prompt and efficient, the diner menu had an option for a one-person meal and that was pretty sumptuous! The room had I think 5 bottles of complimentary water, which was appreciated.  Some areas of improvement noticed: one, the Fitness centre is difficult to find and is really an apology. Very very tiny with out-dated equipment. The apple and water was welcome, though.

Things that need an improvement is the bell boy, it took our luggage half hour to reach our room. The front desk is always packed and at times they seem confused.

Rooms are good, with wooden furniture and Italian marble in the bath room, but certainly needs refurbishment. Noise and music tunes in mornings and evenings from the main lobby and restaurant, so if you are looking for quiet sleep, do not choose rooms facing lobby or closer to lobby view. TV did not work on first day, guy came in, struggled for 15 mins, and it worked, but then remote did not have any power cells. Was tired asked him to replace next day. and Next day also, it was not replaced, so effectively no TV for both days.

  Located at the Mumbai Airport Domestic Terminal, the hotel approach road is a shabby lane that goes around the Sahara Star. Once inside the complex, however, it is nice. After the usual security checks, my cab drove up to the porch. A hotel staff opened the cab door for me, but that was the extent of assistance I got. I had to get my own luggage out of the cab. No assistance for placings the luggage on the x-ray machine either. Not a single bell boy came forward to assist and I pulled the bag to the reception -thankfully it was a wheeled bag.  The lobby of the hotel, though small, is good. The hotel has an atrium with the rooms built around it, and you can see glass elevators zipping up and down.

  The most attractive strength is the location of this hotel which is very close to the airport as well as on the Western Express Highway. This makes it convenient to have business meetings there. But lot of things need to be upgraded to keep it in the big league. The rooms are old furnished and very ordinary. The worst part is the reception, full of all new people who do not understand anything . I have stayed at this hotel quite number of times and had to confront number of times from locating my bookings on their system to providing a room at 11pm and asking me to vacate at 12 midnight. I have spoke to their front desk managers number of times who are responsive but seem helpless. Breakfast is good and the staff is also very cooperative.

  a very big property - Old but grand ambiance.. a busy Airport hotel.. so no one cares  much about your existence... so positive side... stayed for 2 days.. enjoyed the time spend in those neat and spacious rooms.. vast property, so lonely corridors..  Checkin - Checkout  was bad experience.. fells like they are cursing about one more - overloaded with many guests flowing in from transit stays..  The security/bell boys are waiting for Tips, so be prepared to accept their rude comments if they are not considered well... ;)  breakfast was a good one..

  The only good thing I will say about the orchid is the location is excellent and after they fail miserably they do correct the issue but this is very  annoying management strategy.   Things to improve 1) they do not take Amex. First sign of trouble  2) the check in process is the slowest I've seen in India.  3) the lobby smells like Mould is growing everywhere  4) the room selection they gave me had a worse smell than the lobby the Mould ouder was strong I could not stay in the room 5) the free wifi has no instructions for signing in. They give you a series of letters for the USERID and password. But no one in the hotel knows where and how you access the free wifi. They make it as difficult as possible. I gave up and signed into the wifi when you select their wifi and paid

Its a nice cozy property. Staff and hospitality are top notch. However the hotel needs a renovation, as the style of interior decoration and implements look dated and out of fashion, though they have added a new wing which I have not seen.  Buffet breakfast was excellent. Rooftop restaurant is good too!  I would definitely recommend this hotel not least because of its next door neiborhood to the airport!!

  Go to this place only if its your last option, which is what happened with us. This place needs serious up-gradation in terms both staff and the rooms. The bed was pretty small for me, the bathroom wasnt by default having a shaving / dental kit. They didnt choose to accept an AmEx (american express) card, they created a scene for Rs 10/ which was not accounted for by their system. Restaurant that I went to was Mostly Grills, we went in at 10 and could leave only after 1230 due to the horribly slow service that they have to offer.  I had to wait for 15 mins and almost request 3 different waiters just for an ice cube.. Overall very bad experience it might just have been me but I wouldnt recommend it to any one else...

  Terrible experience at the Orchid hotel Mumbai. Reception staff and the duty manager are very adamant about the policies to the extent of refusing the genuine requests of the guests with ego and attitude.  Seen this behaviour for the first time in Hotel Industry.  Very bad. There is  no way you can modify or cancel your reservations.  Once you have provided the card details you are trapped and bound to suffer. Seen for the first time such strictness about check in and check out timings. That too when the rooms are free. Overall a big thumbs down from me.

  Location is closer to the airport and you can skip the mumbai traffic before you pick your flight. Hotel facilities are good and clean. But otherwise, it is always crowded and filled with traffic once you step out, given that its closer to the airport.  Wi-fi is charged exorbitantly which is a huge minus and there are major issues while connecting too. This is extremely important when you are a business traveller.

You might came to know that WiFi is chargeable or breakfast is not included in the tariff and you land up paying more in the hotel.  Good thing and 1 star I had given for the quality and taste of food at Boulevard coffee shop on first floor. Restaurant manager Rohit who had well taken care off, my star goes to that person only.

  When one reads about Orchid, it is called an ""Ecotel"". At check in and all inside, it is a nice business hotel. Good rooms, nice spacious and  well maintained. Artistically made up lobbies. Waterfalls and what not. Rooms are really spacious when compared to Mumbai hotels. But aren't they a bit too cold? And air conditioning not easy to adjust?  Best part of the hotel the other day was one could literally walk from domestic terminal arrivals to this hotel in seven minutes flat. On many airports, it is farther away to reach another part of the terminal itself. Though this advantage is going to away as Air India shifted operations to International terminal. That one is maybe 12-15 minutes cab ride away.

  This is not a 5 stars hotel! The room wasn't clean in particular the bathroom. The mastress was of bad quality. There was a weird smell in the corridor. In addition, the hotel asked us to pay 900 roupies for going to the airport (we paid 200 Roupies for coming)!  I will definitly not recoment this hotel as I find it too expensive. We stayes in budget accomodation in India and the quality was better than this hotel.

  Absolutely average hotel.. The only thing going for it is that its literally a stone's throw away from the airport.. I stayed here for 5 nights and it started with the check in process which was not smooth at all.. You apparently have to deposit a sum of money with the reception in case you avail of room service or other stuff.. I was then given a damp smelling room which was then changed after a whole lot of deliberation.  The new room was good but its the other things that bug you. For e.g.  1) Outside food not allowed. I have stayed in Radisson Blu and Crowne Plaza and they dont have this ridiculous policy. I can understand if the hotel food is good, but that too is very average and nor worth the exorbitant amount they charge. 2) No free WiFi. I couldn't believe my ears when

  The worst thing about this hotel is the speed of check in and check out. It takes ages and they are not apologetic about this either. The duty managers are cold and unfriendly. I am an Orchid Gold Member but I was spoken to in a very brusque manner while requesting for a one hour late checkout. The attrition rate of front desk staff appears to be very high- I see new faces every time I visit the hotel. Seriously, the entire front office staff including the duty managers need to be given a course on customer management. If the hotel sees its feedback on booking.com, it appears that every second person is complaining of time for checkout and checkin but obviously nothing is being done about it.

This was very surprising, because we have been to many hotels which are better than Orchid (Marriot for example) and they have never had a problem with outside food. Nevertheless, we obliged and did not take the food to our room. Instead, we were innocently eating near the car park area. All of a sudden, the chairman of the hotel, yes the CHAIRMAN of the hotel came up to us and started speaking VERY VERY RUDELY TO US just for eating in the car park.

The reception staff can't parrot handbook to deal with guests but they need maturity. And, this they lacked comfortably. The management needs to be blamed more than the staff.

Worst was when we were told that we can not take a rum cake we had got from Delhi as gift for our friends in Mumbai. Reason: Outside food is not allowed in.  OMG!!  Why would a starred hotel be so insecure about its food? Check-in: In which hotel in the world, do you have to stand for 25 minutes before you are even noticed before getting checked in? Front desk is very impersonal and cold.  Not an attribute of a starred hotel, forget about a 5 star one. After check-in: The way to the lifts is across a narrow (very narrow) passage enroute a toilet. And the door of that toilet is always open! Really, not

  Spent a long time at the reception desk thanks to the novice team of Anant, Omkar and Ruchira who were grappling with a group checking in at the same team and dealing with guests of a fairer skin colour. After raising the voice which is how most things work in India, the duty manager took us to the side and got us checked in and upgraded to club rooms. As we were checking in early next morning, he was kind to take a request for packed breakfast which was indeed ready. The rooms were comfortable, all amenities present and the washroom area clean and of appreciable decor.

Rooms: Foul smell (I believe its from the moisture trapped in the carpet) in the room that wont go away. Checked another room, but same state. Its got a stale smell which can give you a headache if your nose is too sensitive. Rooms are small, temperature control is more complex than flying a plane or it didn't work the way it should have.

Staff was on the whole very pleasant and eager to solve any problems.  One thing that they could not help out with though, and I am rather surprised by it, is my request for a thin pillow. I can't sleep on the big fluffy pillows that hotels tend to provide, and prefer to sleep on a relatively thinner pillow (say about 2.5"" thick, nothing more). Was hoping that this being a 5 star category hotel, they would have some options. But alas they had none except the standard pillow provided in the room. That was a bit of a disappointment.

  The Orchid Ecotel is officially the worst 5 star hotel I have stayed at. Unhygienic, rude and unpleasant. Low quality toiletries, un- clean bathrooms, smelly towels, no free wifi."", slow room service, dirty corners. Marathi Indian owners shouldn't run luxury hotels, they just don't have the courage to provide luxury.  Do yourself a favour and don't book this hotel.  Thank you!

  The entrance doesn't give you a sense of arriving into a good hotel. The porch area is such that there is a small pick-up and drop-off point.  The hotel has an old feel to it.  Staff was not very helpful...seemed to be overworked.  I liked the size of the room. There was a seperate sitting area.  The coffee shop was chaotic during breakfast and the staff were not able to cater to everyone.

  Check in for 3 nights with family, 2 small kids. This was one of the worst star hotels I have ever stayed in. The check in is like a railway station ticket counter.  The staff are rude and F&amp;B is tasteless. Upon checking in or booking you are not told that outside food is not allowed and I was stopped for getting in food for kids. I spoke to the duty manager who looked the other way and got his big daddy F&amp;B manager called Shantanu who had the biggest attitude and disrespect for customers. He claimed it was a policy and when I asked for the written policy stating so he had no ans and stood threateningly with security challenging my request to show such rules and that why is it not clearly mentioned. Obviously this was the only bully way to get people to eat in his restaurants

It is not upto the mark for stay. This is my personal view. Menu of this hotel is so costly not to reach for common man. Linens were so good very clean.

  I have stayed 3 times at this place in the last one year.  For those who need to be close to the airport, it is pretty good.  The building is slightly old, so the structure has a lot of pillars and it does look run down at places.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food at the main restaurant is excellent - a lot of Mumbai folks come here just for the food.  The gym is a bit small and cramped. The 2 treadmills and 1 cross-trainer are in good condition.  The main issue is that there is nothing one can do outside the hotel. No place to walk, or shop or hang around. You will need a vehicle to reach any place that may be entertaining. The place outside the hotel is full of traffic and on one side of the hotel is a dirty, congested, slum area.  All-in-all, a good place to stay

  Stayed in August last week. My booking was from 10.30 AM with compli airport pickup(which is just half km away) but the person at airport did't have me listed for pickup but later arranged drop at hotel. Front office was a big negative as they avoid making eye contact with you and you wait something like 15-20 minutes just to have  their esteemed attention. Though I had confirmed reservation but no room was available and was asked to wait for 1-2 hr. Hotel lobby looked like a village fair with all villagers occupying every space available there and I was doubtful whether I was in the right hotel. Later after 1/2 hr I insisted that I be given a room as I told them that I see lot of people checking out. Room was given which is bare with not much amenities. No iron board, no

  I really try to find positive things to say about hotels I stay in, but in the case of this hotel I genuinely cannot find anything good to say.  I stayed at the hotel twice (Pre-booked.  If I had the choice I would not have stayed there again). The check-in (And check out) was chaotic, the Wi-Fi didn't wok, the service was pathetic (Especially in the restaurant on the 1st floor), the rooms small and poorly lit.  Finally to top it off, the gym consists of 2 treadmills (One wasn't working), 1 rowing machine, 1 elliptical trained and 1 weight machine.  (I have a better equipped gym in my home).  I would give this hotel 3 stars at best.

  The first thing that I noticed about the hotel was its Pink-coloured vehicles - which was making a unique statement for the hotel itself. We were welcomed at the hotel by irritating rain showers which got us partly drenched and to add to this already initiated irritation - the slow check-in process. The whole of front desk staff was trying please one angry lady who seemed to have a language barrier, but I thought to myself that this shouldn't be the reason that other guests have to suffer.  The room was good, with an Airport view under dark skies. Mini-bar was well equipped. Bathroom and toilet seemed decent enough for the price, again. In-room dining was somewhat on the higher end, money wise. Had a decent sleep, so there's nothing to complain about in the room, at least.

The wardrobe was dirty and the safe there has several numbers missing hence you need to use a password based on whatever numbers function! There is no free wi-fi as well.

The security is very good and very professional, I did feel safe here. The facilities are good but come very over priced. For 2 small beers I was charged 1300 ruppees, this is not good or reasonable but actually robbery. The wifi is 1000 rupees per 24 hours and was not reliable at all!

  To sum it up this hotel is an absolute disgrace to the term 5 star. How it's achieved this ranking I will never know.   After having failed to pick me up from the airport, I had to call the hotel. Half an hour later, I'm finally collected.  The hotel itself is tired and dated, the rooms more so. Putting a new TV in the room doesn't qualify as any sort of modernisation.   The Wifi code you need to get daily as it changes and you need to pay for it.   There are 5 sun beds by the roof top pool that you can't move to the sun as the roof covers everything. The only view you have from the pool area is of some bamboo scaffolding and plastic.   The restaurant prices are expensive, room service is actually cheaper.   The reception team are extremely unhelpful, not to mention useless.

The service in the restaurant was not good as the wait staff were not very friendly and it took a long time to get anything. Lacking choices we had the same experience for dinner and breakfast the next morning. WiFi is very poor even when you upgrade to the premium service. Not a chance of getting a Skype call home to work. No ironing board in the room which was unexpected but a call to housekeeping and a short wait and one was delivered. At 6'1' tall, the ironing board was very low. Finally some of the fixtures and fittings had seen better days, even in the new wing. On the positive side, the driver and car we hired for the day to

  I stayed in the hotel for 5 days in May 2015, The hotel was excellent and the buffet dinner and breakfast were great considering the hotel is nearly a five star property. Although the staff took time at check-in and were looking bit confused as the hotel was booked by my company and the staff were not able to find where to put my records on computer. The main point of the hotel was the location , it is just a 2 minute drive to the airport.   Overall very good experience , would like to stay in the hotel for the next time visit also.

  The hotel looks great from outside and the decor as you step in does nothing to take this away.  But.. and that is the biggest but.. they just don't care for you.  The check in took 15 minutes.. I can't still believe this. And the bell boy took another 5 to appear.  The room service was just ok and so were the amenities and when I thought it was time to leave and nothing else could go wrong in just a one night business stay, they treated you like I can't even mention at the complimentary buffet breakfast.. not enough place, too many people to wait on you but none to take care of you and when you got up to serve yourself something you won't be able to get back to your seat... and why? Cos someone else took it cos these attendants were ""courteous"" enough to take the cutlery off !!

Practically being inside the domestic airport and an efficient drop service that objective was achieved.  Other than that room was good (got a voluntary upgrade). The pool on the top floor was small but good. Room service was very slow but the food was nice. The breakfast buffet was also decent.  The check out was a disaster.

  Excellent Hotel in terms of ambiance and room quality. No doubt about it. Room charges are quite decent as compared to the room quality.   But  Hotel makes sure that if they are decent amount form staying, they will cover it through other means. Wifi is chargeable which is not in other similar hotels. and the most saddest part (made me to give star) was the buffet dinner quality and the price. I paid Rs. 1800 for a Buffet dinner (one person) which is like huuuuge and quality is not at all OK. Taste of the food was just OK and not at all worth 1800. Not even 800 Rs. The place wehrein hotel is located is such that once you enter Hotel, you cannot go out for food. So hotel has ensured to take the maximum benefit out of this. Hotel should surely look into this.

  Located close to the Mumbai airport. In my view, it would be really foolish for anyone other than a person who just wants a decent (just decent) place for a few hours of stay in Mumbai to even think of this hotel.  A really busy hotel, check in and check out can easily take upwards of 20 minutes, you normally have a queue up there. If you have a flight, suggest keep some time handy for the check out. Rooms are very spacious by Mumbai standards and all basic amenities are available. WIFI is paid. The buffet has a decent spread for breakfast but is perpetually crowded. Room service would be better. This hotel has a very high rotation of guests. Recommended only if you are there for a few hours or at best a day, unless you like mad rush. Avoid like a plague if on a holiday.

I had to walk outside in the streets for half an hour to reach an exchange to collect cash.  The food was too expensive and tasteless.  Then the room was also smelly n old.  There was no mobile range within. And the wifi was very poor.  I changed to Marriot and am very satisfied. Never choose this hotel!!!!

  Location is a big deal in Mumbai and besides airport is a convenience. This hotel is there with eco friendly title seems little old and all furnishings need freshness. I was upgraded by cartels staff and given three lunch/ dinner free coupons apart from free breakfast. Though free wifi is equally essential nowadays. The hotel atmosphere is homely and easy but rooms particularly bathrooms need better fittings.The tub was slippery and rather risky after the use of soap or shampoo. It's five star but more value additions needed at room level.

In my three day stay i had 8 such trips to reception.    Food is average at a high cost.

  The Orchid has a lot going for it, especially the location right next to the airport and the fairly large rooms. The breakfast and lunch spread was pretty expansive.

Also, not having complimentary wi-fi is a major no-no in this day and age when even small and budget hotels offer wi-fi at no charge. The hotel needs to move with the times.

Being geographically in the centre of the city, the hotel is ideally located for one to go to any part of the city in the north or south. Uber and Ola cabs are available in abundance. The complimentary domestic airport drop any hour is a boon. The best you could get at a very reasonable price.

  The location of a property usually has some bearing on its general attitude, tempered by factors such as season, competition and brand among others. On average, the better the location, the better the business, the less the concern in the hotel for guest experience.  Perhaps that's why I experienced what I did.  Rooms - Apart from a tatty wired console with a single button that brings the AC temperature to 24 degrees there doesn't appear to be anything eco friendly in the hotel; likely a moniker thought up by marketing. - Hot water is liberally delimited by spurts of cold. - Badly maintained; jammed doors, leaking showers... - No thought to ergonomics in room design - Faulty, ill-configured wi-fi - Slow, unresponsive television set top box - Unresponsive staff who ignore your

  Stayed with friends for 4 nights. Fell in love with Mumbai and the hotel. Rooms were very clean &amp; comfortable. The buffet breakfast is to die for...awesome spread and well prepared too...I've gained a coupla pounds during my visit i think. I stayed in a club room &amp; my friend stayed in a deluxe room, not much difference though. will definitely stay at orchid for my next visits. check out the early bird offer &amp; other offers on the hotel website.

  I had the opportunity to stay at  this hotel on my last visit to Mumbai. This was my first stay at the hotel though i have stayed frequently in other hotels . The hotel has seen better times . The staff is very polite and cordial . The senior staff appears to be committed . The coffee shop is quite nice and the food quality is good . Concierge services are also efficient . The hotel taxi seems to be controlled by the concierge and seems to be having some nexus . Better to hire taxis from independent operators .

  Noisy, cheated at the restaurant, no internet access and above all, extremely poor customer service.  They offered my a complimentary dinner. Asked the waiter what drinks I may have, included in the voucher. Ordered a beer, since he told me it was included. When leaving the restaurant, they call me to charge 10 GBP for the drink.  Customer Service-Complaint completely useless. There are much better hotels in Mumbai.

  I am staying here as I write this review. No help from the staff outside or inside for your luggage - in fact, 1st 5 star hotel where you pick up your own luggage and put in on the belt. The doorman was engaged in a conversation with another member of staff but did open the door for me, no greetings offered at all.   Check in was alright, slow but ok. I was told my room number and given my room key, their job is done. No one to help again!!  Room is tidy, good size, great ac, all amenities you need. Bathroom is also good.   A call to the reception to enquire about wifi is met with the speediest transfer without even listening to my reason of call. I called again only to be told the duty manager can only tell you about wifi as he is the only person in the hotel who knows about

  Stayed for a night as a last minute choice since it was raining in Mumbai. Again for a business trip with the boss so chose to stay here. It's a nice hotel with spacious rooms and close proximity to the domestic airport (almost walking distance). Rooms are also clean and well done up.  The south Indian restaurant had a food festival going on and the cuisine served was quite authentic and nice too with the whole ambiance adding to the good evening.  Overall one of the better choices in Mumbai in the Airport vicinity and the staff are also helpful.

  The Orchid Hotel near the Mumbai domestic airport gave me pretty good value for my money. They gave me a complimentary airport transfer (from and to the airport) and their check was fairly efficient. The rooms are pretty good though could do with a few more classier touches. The access to the cafe and restaurants was a little confusing as I think the property is actually two building connected by passageways. But finding your way around was an adventure in itself! The buffet breakfast and dinner was actually quite good - decent variety and adequate service. Their gym could definitely use and upgrade though.

  I have always fancied about this hotel from the time I visited first in 1998-99. Vegetarian lunch was so delicious and I can still remember that taste. One of the peculiar thing about this hotel is it's ECOTELness. You really do not realise the importance of preserving nature and natural resources. I have learnt after visiting this amazing place. Karaoke is one more attraction for ALL ages and it is worth enjoying each moment, song wither alone or with someone.

  The hotel is definitely not a 5Star property. The rooms are musty with poor air conditioning. The beds are lumpy. Had to change rooms twice- once due to air conditioning not working properly and second time around because the bed broke due to wooden beams being rotten. Finally ended up in a 'suite room' which opened up over the dining area and had constant noise from the music playing in the background and chatter of the diners below. The food spread is very mediocre!!! The staff is so poorly trained that had to call them thrice to deliver room service. The travel desk is also a big rip off. Only positive I can say is the hotel is stone's throw away from the airport. Much better properties in Bombay for the price.

  The orchid is located favorably close to the domestic terminal of the CSIA Mumbai. The hotel claims to be a five star but is far from there.   1. The checkin process (despite an advance corporate booking) took close to 20 mins.  2. Add to that, they do not accept Amex cards. So either pay in cash or some other card. 3. The first room given to me was already allocated to somebody else. Had the bell boy not known that, it would have been an embarrassing start of the stay.  4. The second room was a smoking room, smelling of decade old unclean carpet. Add to that, the queen bed room was a twin bed room with the two beds aligned together. :)  5. On giving an earful to the duty manager, I was given a club room. The club room located on the top floor did not seem much different from

  NOT even close to 2 star, I don't know why they self market their self as a 5 star properly.  Worse check-in experience, had to wait for almost half an hour for no reasons.  Worse front desk help. Hotel has hardly any place to meeting place, very small front lobby which was always completely packed/busy. Rooms are small, old, dirty, smelly. AC kept making noise till late night.  After repeating complains someone came over and tried to fix it for about 40 mins (this is at 5am at night during weekdays!!), then only they assign different room in which the bed hardly had room for half of the body to sleep.

  I am regular visitor to Mumbai and most of the times I stay at The Orchid, primarily because of its location and it adjoins the Domestic Airport.

Maybe because they feel they can run the show with any attitude and arrogance just because they are close to the airport and they get guests anyways!  I landed in Mumbai on a badly pouring 23rd June and had to visit a business associate and the meeting went on till late night. I had an early morning flight at 6 and preferred to stay close to the airport and as always chose The Orchid.

The rooftop grill restaurant has a fantastic view of the airport runway &amp; is a great place for plane spotting, alas, dinner for 4 set us back just over €100.

I requested front desk to shift me to 1 queen bed room but not received any positive reply. Found cockroach in the washroom. Breakfast not included in the room tariff. So that advantage also not available this time. I prefered for room service which was very costly. It is better to go for Buffet lunch / dinner. You will find more options nearby when you are spending 5.5 K + for one night.

  Hotel Orchid, a beautiful hotel situated at a stone's throw away from the Domestic Airport at Mumbai takes you in not only with its beautiful lobby and warm reception but with the quality of food it serves. I was lucky to be there when they were celebrating the taste of south India with a ""South of the Vindhyas"" food fest. They were serving excellent southindian  savouries including sea food cooked the waythey do it in the south. The restaurant was dressed up in typical south indian design with even the stewards dressed up like traditional south Indians. The pick up at the airport, the reception, the check-in formalities, the rooms, the house-keeping, the menu, the bar and the two capsule lifts all add to the charm of Orchid.

Now after five years it looks worn out, rooms look drab, the bed does not look made up for the guest, and the so called beautiful 'chandelier' no more functioning... It was a six hours stay before connecting on an international flight. Had a quick bite and asked for a wake up call at 1 in the morning, only to be woken up by 10.30 pm wrongly. The room looked so drab and dull, and the bed was not really made up well. Looked a bit like some sat there and got up just before we arrived. The check in was a breeze. The place was crowded i am sure mostly with transit passengers. The coffee shop was live and full even at one in the morning. On

They charge for Wi-Fi but for me it was free since I used an online booking portal to get the bookings done.  The complimentary breakfast was awesome. The varieties were great and they kept in mind the people visiting from around the globe, so had options for all. The pick up and drop facility to the airport was on time.  Overall a good experience.

  My wife and I were in Mumbai for our respective official visits. I gifted from the Leela to this wretched hotel to be with her. She had a suite billed which smelt damp. The beer in the minibar wa warm an I called for a beer from room service which they charged 450 INR and it was slightly cold.the agony started when during our dinner, we were booked under MAP and we informed that it would be the two of us and were ready to pay extra if there were any charges. The so called duty manager assured is that the rates were same. We went down to the coffee shop and bang in the middle of the dinner we were asked for our room numbers twice , we told the gentlemen that we were in te same room. Then came a lady who flashed a voucher and told us to get a free meal voucher to which we replied

  I selected to stay in Orchid Hotel along with my wife on the basis of its marketing talk over website. However on check in room no 526 I found that TV was not working,room lights had a problem of getting switched off and insufficient qty of tea facility for two persons. On my repeated follow up it took about 40 min to restore things. I wonder how they claim it about 5 star rating to the hotel and how come room is not fully inspected before allotting it to the guests. Arvind kalvit Pune

  It was 4th or 5th visit in 2 years. Attraction is one very good hotel so near to airport. Having discussed plus points all the times  I will  just point out those few things that could be improved, First and most important is reception counter. Come what may it is going to take minimum 15 minutes  both for check in and check out. Reason is its over crowded. At times you have to wait in que  for check in. Do not know if staff trained like that or its always fully booked. Other point is no free wifi . Its a must everywhere so may be one hr free wifi can be provided. Checked in at around 5.00 pm, well set room and at 6.00 house keeping asking if i need something. Liked that. The best thing  which I appreciate  is there fleet of cars/ muvs all painted in ourple orange mix colour

  I happened to stay here in Dec 2014 instead of my usual Courtyard Marriott stay that I like very much and I would say it was a mistake having chosen this property. A mistake not to remember but to be cautious in future. The staff at the reception is unhelpful and takes a lot of time while checking-in (took me 55 minutes by watch instead of prior booking and flight arrival intimation). Although they confirmed an early check-in while accepting the booking but denied at my arrival there and I had to change in the restroom and leave for my meeting and had to do an evening check-in. Property is worn out and the carpets in the lobby are dirtier than even you hadn't washed the ones at your home for over two years. Buffet breakfast is just average and nothing great. Variety in the

  Just an average airport area hotel -- nothing special. Staff average, rooms average, food and service average.   But -- a fatal flaw for a business traveler -- horrible WiFi.

Every ten minutes I had to go through the cumbersome sign-in process again. But -- worst of all -- while I was having all these problems the staff were slow to respond. Several times I was told someone would phone my room to help. I had to call back several times before I could finally get the help needed -- password for the walk in guest WiFi.

  Located near International &amp; Domestic Airport Orchid is one of the old 5Star properties. Because of its past 5Star status service quality level is high.   Rooms are good, cleanliness, staff, check in time and price are worth appreciation.    I got chance to go only for Buffet Breakfast and it was awesome. Huge choice, very courteous and hardworking staff trying to make your day.  However the place becomes too congested and guests start developing nervousness at around 9:45-10:00am as its peak and no place to sit.  No other complains. Also do remember to plan your ride well in advanced to go out as it may take a little time for call taxi to arrive at the hotel due to traffic around Airport.

  Stayed here over a weekend &amp; had a great experience!  Booked online on their website and got a great deal for the 'Club Room'. The initial booking showed a booking for only 1 adult, which was quickly adjusted to 2 adults. Since I love airplanes, I requested for a room over looking the airport &amp; was granted room no 706 (after some initial confusion over a booking by another 'Prathamesh').  The room offered superb views of the airport without any noise filtering through. The infrastructure is in great shape in spite of the hotel being a little old. The F&amp;B was promptly delivered to the room. Found all staff to be courteous.  The roof top bar is a great place to chill out with a group &amp; will definitely visit the bar again! The Wi-Fi worked great though kept disconnecting at times!

  The only reason for staying at this hotel is the location. Convenient if you need to take an early morning flight out of Mumbai.  Otherwise the hotel presents itself rather poorly. Some specifics:  1. At check in I discovered that my booking through booking.com was not quite what it was supposed to be. The first night was more expensive while the others were at a lower rate. The net result is that if you check out earlier than planned you get hit with a higher rate. To be fair this problem may be with booking.com and not the hotel but it led to a bit of a misunderstanding at the time of checking in.  2. Room service is just pathetic. Food took a long time in coming. They just handed over a bottle of beer without a glass and made no attempt to even open it. The chicken burger had

  I had to visit Mumbai in 3rd week of Apr for an official trip and stayed at The Orchid - one of the worst stay of my life. The bad omen started when my card got blocked due to key pad issue in one of their POS machine. Though, I had paid the money in cash, but the front office staff and the manager was highly unorganized and confused about the whole billing  process. To add to the misery, I got a call from them on 16th night to check out. When I had confirmed that my booking is till 17th May, they checked their records and eventually the confusion got sorted out.  Overall, the entire place sucks and I would never want to visit or advise anyone...My one cent advise to the management - please change your attitude or will get perish soon....

  Although the locational advantage gives this hotel an edge over others whenever you visit mumbai, Its not equipped to handle the rush which pour in. It took almost more than 45 min to check in. There were people who were waiting for more than 90 min just check in. Either they have over booked and issued the reservation slip and the rooms were not free to allocate.  Since its close to airport people come in bunches, They need to deploy more manpower to handle check in - and checkout activities seperatly. Although my checkout was just done in 5-7 min. The hotel architecture is such that the windows does not open. so the outside air is not permitted. It still have old Big TV units in the room instead of LEDs.

From the entrance area to the very top floor the elegant decor and fountains bring more attraction to the place. 4.

  I'm surprised by some of the other reviews as they are so different our experience. The hotel was nice, our room was clean and quiet, the staff was fine and the breakfast was good and plentiful. A driver dutifully picked us up and dropped us off at the airport which was 10-15 minutes away. The hotel is visually right next to the airport (we could see a runway from our room) but you have to go in a roundabout way to get to and fro. We were surprised at the car security upon arrival at the airport but I guess the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai left their mark. Note that, as in a lot of third-world countries, people in poverty coexist with those better off and you do have to drive through a slum to get to the hotel.

  The promoters have put in the finest infrastructure in place to build the hotel if only they had paid 10% attention to the staff they had hired they would have good loyal customers. The only USP they may harp upon is the proximity to the airport but the staff with their slow and unprofessional attitude will ensure that you will miss your flight!  they are overbooked and understaffed. the staff at the billing will try to fleece you if you do not check your bill well.Also ensure that you get your deposits or block on credit card refunded before you leave the counter or you may have to follow up for days before they do it and if you forget you may lose the money too. They do not even offer free Wi-fi even the smallest coffee shops in the Mumbai now offer free wi-fi.

  A trade association that I am a managing committee member of , had its quarterly meeting in the meeting hall of this Hotel. Hence for the sake of ease, I decided to book a room in the same hotel. Big mistake!  I booked online and received a confirmation . Normally the confirmations from hotels carry the guest name, the address of the hotel and sometimes the direction to the hotel ; nevertheless in Orchid's case only the confirmation number.  I was supposed to check in at around midnight . I reached the hotel and at the check in the guy was totally clueless. It seems that he was looking at the format of the booking confirmation of his hotel for the first time!  I was given a room ( number 401, if you want to know). The room was absolutely dirty, with hair all around ( yes, you

  Stayed there on a business visit from 4th till 7th April. At the time of checking in the person took my credit card and blocked an amount equivalent to 2 days stay. At the time of check out they again swiped my card for a fresh trx. The amount blocked earlier has not been unblocked even after a week  now after reminders. If the hotel boasts itself to be a 5 star , this is surely not expected.

  Orchid Hotel Mumbai  What can I say about my experience of staying in this hotel.   Let’s start with the good parts. It has wifi and good TV channels.   Now for the less than good parts. (go to the end of the best part of my review - Checking out_)  Checking In:  Took 36 minutes to check in as there were only 2 staff members on duty and a large line. This theme continued the whole week anytime I needed to speak to reception.  The first room. Damp feel about it, electrical sockets that were dangerous because not screwed in and dead flies that were not ever cleaned up. The wardrobe door couldn’t close because it wasn’t deep enough and that meant the light inside wouldn’t turn off.   I had an inside room which meant I had to keep the curtains closed because people in the lift could

  The hotel is strategically placed and extremely close to the airport. Stayed here for 3 nights. It provides complimentary pick up/drop from the domestic airport. However its on a shared basis. Which means if you have other guests arriving at the same time you have to wait for others to come and then take the pink shared cab to the hotel. I had to wait for over 20/25 mins for other guests to come and then the cab to arrive however there was a gentleman to greet you from the hotel. The check in was smooth. I was told wifi is complimentary but when asked for the password I was informed its chargeable. When I insisted my booking confirmed its complimentary, then they arranged the same. The first room I checked in had issues with the room card and it was an inter connecting room

  We pass through Mumbai once a year and always stay at the Orchid. It has the best location of any of the hotels (equal to Sahara, which is next door), not only because it is right next to the airport, but because it is right next to the main north-south highway of Mumbai. It means that if you want to go anywhere north or south Bandra, Goregaon, Mills district), it is quick to get around. Also, while some of the higher-grade hotels nearby can sometimes cost the same as the Orchid, they don't usually include the hotel pick-up, which means adding an extra $40 or so to the bill. Orchid usually includes the pick-up (in their nice, clean pink cars) for free. We often get an upgrade and did again on our most recent trip this March when we stayed twie. However, we were a bit

No problem with an early check in and they arranged a car to pick me up/drop me off to/from the airport which was very helpful and a good facility.  Service overall was very good.   Because of my unusual arrival/departure time I only eat in the all day café - food options were very limited and not that great.  Dinner options looked a lot better, but timing didn't fit in with my schedule.  Being an airport hotel I would have thought it would have better all day food options.

I had waited for 30 minutes and no one came to attend me as I am not an important person to him. Orchid staff had seen me twice but didn't came to me.

During my last visit i got the room in fifth floor and the rooms are very good compared to the earlier ones. This is close to the IRLA market place where you can do shopping. If you cross the signal there are also many options to have your food if you get bored with the routine.

  The Orchid is located adjacent to the Mumbai airport and is a great spot to stay on a business trip as well as it is located mid way between the central business district and emerging western suburb business districts like Andheri and Goregaon.  The property has a large number of rooms and owing to its long standing good reputation is usually very busy. This means checkin times can be prolonged or checkout lines may be long. This is a pain point I have experienced on multiple occasions.  That said, every other aspect of the hotel is great. The food is excellent and fresh.The buffet spread leaves little to be desired.  Business class rooms are large and well appointed. Airconditioning is crisp.  A safe bet anytime.

Wi-Fi is not free and you have to pay (again more that in Kempinski) but you have to pay for every device you want to connect. For me there is no reason to stay in that hotel for that money ...

Though plenty of staff was visible somehow service was average to say the least.The tea served was over brewed and not served properly. The meals too were very average.

  Hi, Back at ORCHID Mumbai again for a month. It has been more than 3 weeks already and I thought this is the right time for me to add my comments when everything is still fresh. First the Bads:  In 5 months Service has drastically gone down. Most of the old good staff have left and the new staff don’t seem to have been trained enough. Biggest problem is lack of accountability. Had to wait at the airport for almost an hour for the driver to take me, as he wanted to wait for another passenger to be picked up. This is after me emailing my flight details requesting for a pick up and receiving the confirmation. Even the duty managers have changed and most of them do not have any value for client’s time. When the staff here say “will have it done in 5 minutes” means they have no idea

  Since the moment you enter the hotel it is quite clear that it is quite old. Rooms were clean but honestly the roof was kind of low and the furniture definitely old.   Plus, if there is some kind of celebration at the restaurant you can rest assured that you will be able to take part and enjoy the music - even from your room, thanks to the thin doors. Not something I really enjoyed since I had to leave one morning at 6:30 for business.   Positive note - the hotel staff was super.

  This is the first time I stayed at this hotel because of an event - and will be the last. The claims to a 5 star are belied by the sad rooms, awful service and amenities. 1. The hotel is well located near the airport but the access is so difficult through narrow, slum like roads. 2. The rooms are dated; 1990s decor. 3. The bed was really hard; the carpet on the floor was softer. 4. To log onto wifi was a tedious exercise. One had to call a number which no one would pick up and then get the login and password. Why not give these details at check-in itself? 5. WIfi cost Rs. 500 a day! When most hotels give this free why charge for it? 6. The reception staff was untrained. I waited for 10 minutes in front of a trainee who was just pressing buttons on a keyboard waiting for the lone

  This hotel claims to be of 5 star rating, but always lower priced in comparison. Old property, and well maintained. Rooms are spacious, but housekeeping, maintenance and air quality are primitive. HVAC is noisy.  Provides free airport pick up which works effectively.  No free WIFI.  Service quality is low; especially front office staff.  Breakfast menu is good.  Choose this hotel if you want to stay close to domestic airport, and are constrained on budget.  Otherwise nothing special about it.

  Close to the airport, stayed for two nights after a decade perhaps. The outside has become cramped and the hotel has become hidden. Some good changes in the environment, some not so good.  Had meals at the terrace restaurant, the food was good. We had lobsters, the meat was dressed up to make it easy for eating. However it lost some of the charm as it changes the experience. The staff was courteous and not intrusive.   The lifts are a bit confusing and take a lot of time.  Breakfast spread was fantastic and good to taste.  Overall, good for stay, for the price it is offered at.

  I would describe it as an experience not like that of a 5-Star Hotel, though things were acceptable. It's very close to the Airport which is an added advantage in a city like Mumbai where travelling time takes a toll on you. Apart from that they've got a permanent person available at the airport to arrange for Pick-ups in their Trade Mark Pink Cars, which kind of appeals a lot.  Food in the Restaurants was good but not very satisfied with the service, as it took a lot of time for check-in and other formalities.Besides the rooms were a little old fashioned having old CRT TVs (atleast on the 3rd Floor where I stayed), huge issues with the Network - Vodafone Network didn't work well, DTH too was going off network, Power Tripping leading to blacking out in rooms a couple of times.

  It was one day trip and chose this hotel due to close proximity to airport. The rooms are well done and good.wifi is average. But everything gets marred by the pathetic response by the staff in reception and restaurent ( boulevard).  Just to give an example:They are so punctual that in the morning before check out to catch flight; I wanted to grab a quick bite. The incharge at the breakfast area would not allow me to touch the plates even though food was ready. Reason: it was still 6 minutes to go for starting time. Both the guy incharge and chef looked other ways when I said them that I need to catch my flight and can't wait. Finally, they won and I had to leave the hotel without breakfast and an incomplete invoice from reception. In spite of submitting a written complaint,

  My dad and I stayed at the Orchid Hotel in December. Very close to both the Domestic and International terminals. They pick up and drop off even though I had booked the cheapest category of room. The room was very comfortable and as we had checked in around 12 noon they were serving lunch and not breakfast. Despite this I requested if they could do some breakfast items for my 90 years old dad and they duly complied. In fact I had wanted dishes cooked without onion and garlic and they obliged once again.  The wifi was cheap but the service a bit hit and miss - BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY LET DOWN. Everything else was 5 star. In the past I have stayed at the Sahara but this was much, much cheaper.

  This is a place that is at a walking distance (15 mins at strolling speed) from the Mumbai airport and you don't really have to take a cab, if you are traveling light. The setup is so rich that it gives you nostalgic moments the very instant you enter  this hotel. Rooms are very spacious and the furniture is quite old. Controls in the rooms are at the least 15 years old and it will take time for you to get used to them. You will feel much better once you have mastered the controls. Television sets (old bulky ones) at the least 10 years old and they seriously have to look to upgrade them at the earliest.

  There are some pro's and con's to the orchid.  Firstly, they have these great pink cabs that will transport you from the airport to the hotel, and that is a big plus when arriving on a late flight. But make sure you prebook in order to have your name on the list. My agent had not secured the booking, but the orchid Hotel sign holder made a quick call and I was onboard to the hotel in no time. Well done that man!  On arrival, a warm greeting by the staff and security and an easy check in.  At around R10000 (Rupees) per night it is not expensive for the class of hotel.   In the room, everything you need. I couldn't get the TV on, and eventually gave up and went to bed, but the porter should have explained the use of the facilities in the room.

The location of the hotel is a huge advantage for business travelers. Pick up from the airport was very quick and the check in was fast. The rooms are quite adequate, spacious and clean; but are unfortunately beginning to show their age. In fact the entire hotel feels the same way and I feel needs to be done up again.

  We had one afternoon and night before our connecting flight and had booked a non-smoking room. After rejecting a stinking room we got one facing the inside courtyard, very quiet. The bed spread had signs of wear and the furniture looked also worn a bit. We enjoyed the pool on the roof, and later we had dinner on the adjoining roof restaurant grill. However, the portions are very small and pretty expensive (for India). In the evening we took a tuck-tuck to Juhu beach for Rs 200, while the hotel travel desk wanted Rs 1600 for a round trip. In the morning every 5 minutes a free airport drop-off which is very convenient.  The hotel claims to be an Eco hotel, but it did not have double flush toilet and it had a refrigerator in a closed cabinet, thus wasting large amount of energy.

  I got excellent value for my money. Although, I stayed for a single night, I still was quite impressed with this hotel. Located a stone's throw away from the domestic airport, the Orchid hotel boosts of a huge number of rooms. Pick and drop to Airport is usually included in all packages. I stayed in double upgraded room called the executive room and I got a great deal along with breakfast for this room through tripadvisor/ cleartrip.com . As you enter the hotel reception, you come to this gigantic atrium which is a little scary when you see it from the upper floors. There are staircases which take you to the first floor where breakfast is served in the 24 hours coffee shop. This hotel is a very popular place for staying to catch a connecting domestic or international flight.

The rooms were okay, ( not that great), atleast decent enough for what you pay for, but the service quality was well below standards. The hotel is actually very beautiful, but the staff is not courteous at all. Right from the 2 guys at the reception to the people manning the club room floor. Also nobody had any idea as to what my package deal was etc, including the front office staff, which was very strange...cause they are probably the first ones to know it. Seems the sales team didnt bother to inform them and they didnt bother to ask either, which I personally find highly unprofessional. The food was okay not worth the charges at all.

  I normally choose Orchid Mumbai as the closest to domestic airport. They have running fleet between airport and hotel and offer you pick up or drop service round the clock. Locating Orchid guest pick up staff is also easy as they are permanently present at the counter. Rooms are comfortable and the breakfast is excellent with a wide choice of veg and non-veg spreads. Room service always not upto the mark due to the delay in attending calls. Overall I have good experience and most convenient is the meeting facilities. If you have a meeting of national size the hotel is perfect as almost touching airport and no time is wasted for long travel to reach meeting destinations.

I called from outside, from the room, but nobody picked up my call. I was a bit surprised. I could see that the reception was under staffed. Else everything fine. I will visit again next time.

  My first impression about this hotel is not that impressive. Self and tow other colleagues booked a room with three bed accommodation. At the time of booking on line, the size of the room was given to us stating three individual beds will be provided. But at the time of check in we were surprised to see only a double room accommodation!. The staff were adamant in telling us that the superior room is only double occupancy. When we showed the booking voucher with room dimensions and three bed arrangement, the front office staff was not ready to accept. Even the manager was not in a position to resolve the mess-up. Finally he agreed to give a big room next day, that was quite OK. But the toiletries were available only for two. Again we had to remind them to put all. One by one it

  I have stayed at the Orchid hotel near Mumbai domestic airport some years back but this visit has persuaded me that I should stay at the Orchid more often. The check-in process was fast and I got a room on the 4th floor in the new wing overlooking some part of the runway - that was pleasant &amp; quiet. The rooms are large and very well appointed though the lighting could be a bit brighter. The bath room is large with a bath tub and a shower cubicle - I liked the minor innovation of a ledge to sit in the shower cublicle! The hotel charges you for wi-fi and that's not a good idea these days. The reception lobby is not very large and gets pretty crowded. The staff are very helpful and courteous. On the whole a good experience and it is very well located for business meetings on wither

  Stayed here in July'14. Its a bit dated. They have not maintained it. But its neat &amp; clean and very near to domestic airport which is the biggest plus point. You may have to fend for yourself once you checkin at the counter. No porter or any assistance to guide you to youe room. You will have to find it youeself in the maze. But if you are a foreigner some one appears out of the blue to guide you to youe room. The food is supposed to be good here in the restaurant. But since we were in a conference package we were dished out an average tasting meal. Appears that they had done as a favour. They also charge for 2 wheeler parking??? They are taking customers for granted.....

  Orchid has a wonderful view from its roof-top restaurant &amp; bar. You can see the planes take-off and land from the Mumbai airport and it is a nice catch if you can get one of the side seats ... makes conversation almost secondary to the visit.  It is also a very old hotel (by comparison with some of the new ones in Suburbs) and has become musty and traditional overtime. It is a good stay. very convenient if you want to be around the Airport with complimentary transfers too ... yet if you are looking for a contemporary feel, this will be too traditional and old for your taste (and may have one marriage too many being hosted)

  Though I have stayed here many times I am not happy at all. My recent stay was  on two different days early this month. The good part of this hotel is the close proximity to the airport and this is what we look for since the commute gets easier and takes lesser time. The biggest letdown of the hotel is its front office staff. They are not very well trained, not friendly and very rarely are helpful. They do not check the booking and their answer is always a big NO to everything. It is amusing to watch them deal with the guests. First I will give my example. At check out on the first day we were asked to pay for our laundry despite a mail from our company that it was to be billed to them. Despite our request they did not agree and made us pay cash thereby delaying us. The second

  On a brief business visit I stayed at The Orchid, Mumbai. The service was efficient and the rooms, though a little smaller than many hotels are well maintained. Quality of bed linen is good. Bathrooms were well stocked with toiletries.    Vibdhyas - their speciality south indian restaurant is outstanding. I admit that I tasted a few  dishes for the first time in my life. The dal and spinach gravy, Appams and Rice fritters were outstanding. No wonder, a lot of locals visit it for lunch and dinner  Breakfast at the Boulevard was equally good and varied.   I strongly recommend this hotel for true value for money and a great dining experience.

  For a hotel that's a stone's throw from the airport, and is believed to be among the better hotels Mumbai has, The Orchid does a phenomenally shoddy job of managing its guests. The hotel has more than 500 rooms and exactly four check in counters. Result: prepare to spend anything between 45 mins to an hour moving in or checking out. The reception staff is slow and confused.  In our case, the credit card had been billed for a pre-authorisation amount but failed to show up on the hotel servers at the time of check out.  In the rooms, half litre bottles of water are a put off. Even when we asked for one litre bottles and said we'll pay, we couldn't get them!  Also, the swipe in key tends to stop working without provocation. We ended up getting locked out for over 20 mins once.

  Although this is my 4th or 5th stay at the hotel, just thought would share some experiences. One, location is really great bang in the centre of town. My stays at the hotel have been extremely comfortable with courteous staff, great choice of in room dining and comfortable furniture in the room. However, few of my observations are as follows, the check in and check out really takes a lot of time, which can be avoided by deputing more people during peak hours. The television remotes are really a complicated pieces of machinery and would suggest a simpler system. The breakfast lounge is really small and can accomodate maybe 75 pax at a go which means that you will wait your turn till a table is empty.

The front desk personnel treated me as if I was asking for something illegitimate and did not give any response for about one hour. Their body language clearly reflected that they did not care about my queries.There were other guests who faced the same problem as mine. Room allotted to me was giving stale smell, full of moisture.

Dinner :- we ordered for 5 Rotis and received three only and after ordering again we have to wait for 30 mins by the time entire food was cold .  4.	Room keys was not working second day and after requesting twice and waiting for 15 minutes outside room no one came up so personally have to go to reception and get keys .  5.

  This is one of the best places to stay near the Mumbai Domestic Airport. In fact it is located almost within the airport campus and thus you spend minimum time travelling to and from the hotel, which is especially helpful if you have a late night arrival or early morning departure. It offers complimentary pick-up and drop facilities. Rooms, though small are quite nice and segregated into a sitting area and bed area. Room service is ok and food manageable.

I ordered a 1200 INR bottle of red wine. When I checked out and had a look at the bill they had charged me 3200. I had left Mumbai by then but will contact them to try to get my money back but.

  This can be a fine hotel considering the location and the property. However as you enter it definitely does not give you the feel of a 5 star property. Limited parking but given the location can oversee that. Walking distance from the airport really helps though they have efficient pick up and drop services from the airport.  Check in was okay but can surely be faster. Room was okay but is outdated. Compared to the modern days hotel rooms they definitely need renovation. Basic amenities were all there. Internet works fine. Went down to the South Indian restaurant downstairs. The waiters there seem to be trained at Fast food joints and not for fine dining restaurants.. Check out was efficient. Overall a pleasant stay, but expectations were higher so would rate it as average.

  We had our corporate event here in August last week and I stayed for 2 nights here. This is at best a 4 star hotel, not definitely a 5 star as their website claims. So my review is from the perspective of a 4 star hotel's facilities.  The room is spacious. The bed is cozy with enough number and different sizes of pillows. The room has a separate seating area and a wooden wall separates it from the bed to give privacy. The TV is placed on a turn table to cater to both the bed and the seating area.  The bath is small. The shower is archaic, it doesn't have the mechanism to set the hot/cold water knobs at the desired warmth level. Every time the shower is turned off and on (even midst of a bath), one needs to fiddle with the hot and cold water knobs to find the desired position.

  Although this hotel can generally be described as average in terms of 5 star business hotels, it has one major advantage when travelling to Mumbai and that is its proximity to the domestic airport. Mumbai is generally congested and travelling even short distances can take a lot of time and can be very stressful to say the least. If you are using Mumbai as a base for further travel throughout India, then there is really no better hotel than the Orchid Hotel. Although there are ongoing renovations, much of the hotel has aged and this does show in certain areas.

  I have just checked out of this hotel an hour back. The property indeed is awesome. But there are some points which I feel the management should consider:-  1. Time taken to deliver something in the room is quiet long. I was getting late as I had to rush for a meeting. At 0815 I placed a request for a laundry bag to be delivered on my room. The bellboy came at 0830. Just to get one laundry bag, the hotel took good 15 mins. One bag was not enough for me, I asked him to get one more, he disappeared. No hint of him for the next 15 mins. Exasperated,I just dumped my stuff in the bag and left. Cant wait half an hour for one laundry bag.   2. Certain things in the room were not to be found. Laundry bag wasn't there.

They changed room instantly to another one. Now AC didn't work in this one and it took 40 minutes to get it operational.  There were no welcome drinks or fruits. Pool was closed.  Restaurant menu overpriced though a tasty food. During breakfast, most of things are out and no one payed attention to refill.

  Pros Good ambiance Buffet Spread is decent Spacious Rooms  Cons Approach Road can be a horror to navigate Check out can be uncomfortably long  Stayed here during a business trip. Booked a room with one bed but was assigned one with 2 separate beds initially and had to get it changed. Excuse given at reception was that the Hotel IT/Database systems had recently been revamped. Not very professional. Rooms were clean but the coffee-maker smelt like someone had used it to make rotten eggs. It was changed after the second complaint.  The buffet spread is decent but the idea of a midnight buffet is quite innovative. Thumbs up for that. The most uncomfortable part was the check-out. It was quite irritating to see new trainees being put on shift during rush hour in the morning. Nirav

  The Property and location are good but the staff at the Front Office belong to 6 th century BC in terms of Focus and efficiency. The check in took for ever despite advance booking with complete details.  The check process out was a pain.  Multiple transactions are the flavour of the month,in the process multiple guests are made to wait.  At the Buffet restaurant,at dinner and breakfast,there is a sea of staff but all are standing in clusters gossiping,regardless of being called,and if you call for something basic, it comes after the meal.  The Staff is not bothered for anything.

  I was a regular at The Orchid many years ago. So when I booked myself in for one night this time,  I was looking forward to my stay. The Hotel is next door to the domestic airport,  so I landed in a jiffy. The frontage and erstwhile entrance of the Hotel has changed - thanks to an office building that has come up in front. The check-in was slow,  and I was required to pay up a night's charges in advance. The button panel in the glass elevator has rusted,  and has not been replaced.  The room smelt damp,  the upholstery was faded,  but the room was clean. Room service and checkout were slow,  although the service was delivered with a smile.   The saving graces were the food and ambience at their South Indian restaurant,  South of Vindhyas, and their breakfast spread at the coffee

  Since we would have only a short stay in Mumbai the Orchid hotel was our best choice price wise because we did not want to spend a lot of money with a hotel for the length of our stay. At first we got a room with carpet which made my husband's allergies to aggravate.  The next morning we talked to the manager and he promptly accommodated us in a wooden floor room, which was an upgrade from our original room with no cost.  The other thing was that when we made the reservations it was stated that we would have free wi fi but when we got there they said that the policies had just changed for paid wi fi.  The manager also took care of the issue giving us free wi fi. The hotel has nice facilities, spa and different restaurant choices which we particularly liked the one located on the

I went here due to the Ecotel tag , But in Mumbai what is green , there is no space , but it does have a lovely atrium and old socialist era staff that is not always available on the phone . I made multiple calls for getting internet , or getting someone in the reception !

The airport pick up &amp; drop service was excellent and prompt, especially from the international terminal. For domestic pick up, you may have to wait 5 to 10 minutes for the arrival of the vehicle from the hotel, but still it is ok. The airport drop was remarkable, I assume they have 20+ cars for this service itself. The check in &amp; check out procedure was slow.  It’s a little bit old hotel, but decently maintained, especially the new wing. Rooms are big and toilet was clean, but not the standard of a 5 hotel star for sure.

  You really start doubting your choice when you walk towards the lobby; the place doesn't even look like a modest 3-star from the outside, quite ill-maintained at that.

The service is very average though, it took multiple requests to them to get a glass of water and tea on two different days. One time I requested atleast 6 different people for water and it took them 20 mins to serve me one. Apart form this incident I don't think anything else was wrong from service stand point.  Make sure that you take a room that has a window opening in the lobby. The outside view.... lets say it not that good. But if you want some sunlight in the room choose those.

The service quality is poor      Likes: The only thing which works for this may be the proximity to the airport.

  Orchid is 2 mins walking from the domestic airport and is a wonderful hotel.  Reasonable and very pleasant in ambience.  The restaurants have great food, rooms are spacious.  The highlight is the midnight buffet for 550 bucks per person. In Mumbai it is now perhaps the only 5 star serving a mid nigh buffet.  The food at the buffet is yum!.....indian, conti, asian and chaats for starters... think if it.... 2 am in the night there is kheema, pav bhaji and pani puri to eat! unbelievable!

  The orchid is perhaps one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in.  The room was clean and plenty of room, the food was very good, and the staff was extremely helpful and accommodating.  I especially enjoyed the rooftop bar and restaurant and pool.    I was disappointed that when I arrived at 11pm on a Friday night after working and traveling all day in Banglore, my room was not ready for nearly an hour and a half.  That said, the manager on duty did everything possible to make me comfortable while I waited and seemed at least realize that this was a serious problem.    Once I got to the room, it was excellent and in a good location.    The travel desk was helpful in getting me a car to Juhu and to South Mumbai

Just wanted to have a good nights sleep before hitting next day at 7 am for a meeting 2 hours away.  Never had i expected such a treatment from Orchid. Came to know that they had confirmed booking from 5-6 other guests whom had to suffer in the hotel lobby as rooms were already occupied.

  I have been coming to this hotel since 2002 and have found it very reasonable. Lately because of transfer time arriving from London and onward connection to Jamnagar and the other way aound, I have found this hotel fitting my needs like a glove. The shuttle service is brilliant, rooms are neat and clean. I like the rooms in old wing because of the lighter furniture and decor. The breakfast is great. Only gripe is eating meals (room service or otherwise) is expensive.  The staff in the lobby are attentive and would go out of their way in fetching a taxi.  Definitely a place to saty after a long haul flight since it is a few minutes drive from the new international airport and domestic airport is only a stone's throw.

Had lunch at the Vindhyas. Speciality south Indian . Not what  we expected it to be as the Thali that we took hardly looked like  south Indian food. The location is superb , and bang opposite the domestic airport with a free pick up and drop service. Possibly the ony down side is the road works on the main road which don't seem to end making the approach difficult.

By virtue of their being very close to the airport, some may feel that conveyance would be a problem. But they have a complementary pick up and drop from and to airport. Buffet break fast spread was very good. Amongst all food items, the quality of fish was extremely good and worth having a ton.

  The entrance to this hotel is the same as the entry to the domestic airport... it's almost skip hop jump to the airport. It's a pretty good value for money with all 5 star amenities in a place like Mumbai. The rooms are big and clean with a window that gives a great view. Only problem is that the rooms in the new building are good which is little far from the reception, so gotto to walk a bit to reach your room.  I stayed at the 7th floor and the swimming pool is right outside. It's got a nice view, you can have a drink and get a view of the airport runway sitting there. The breakfast has a huge spread, though the sad part is that they don't change the menu. It remains the same spread everyday which can get boring if you are staying for long.

The new T2 is  about 15 minutes drive, through the elevated road. Check in after a long-haul flight was thankfully smooth. The room was smelly. Fortunately a man with a room freshener was around. It seemed the damp, the smell has become a regular feature in all the floors. You can see  incense sticks placed on the corridor.   Ordered for lassi and it was served at room temperature! Never tasted a lassi so hot:-) But it was quickly replaced with a chilled version of the drink. Claimed to be a five star, but there was no

  A location right next to the domestic airport is really convenient for business travelers especially in a city as brimming with traffic as Mumbai. However, if you like to take a walk out and explore the city then this is not really the hotel as there is hardly anything else apart from the airport nearby.  Overall the service is excellent and the best part was that I was provided a complimentary update from a normal room to the suite for a 7 day stay as there was vacancy available. Also, there is complimentary excess to cocktail party on long stay provided. While, I have heard many negative reviews from people but from my experience it was an excellent stay and worth repeating again.

  I first visited this hotel, very convenient for the Domestic Terminal, in 2009 and it was very glossy. Since then, it has become a little rough around the edges.  The staff are polite and generally helpful.   Wifi access is not always consistent.  My room was generally clean although, looking for a dropped earring, I realised that there were crumbs and dust on the carpeted part of the floor, which had obviously not been vacuumed for some time. When I pointed this out, it was remedied quickly though.  I ordered a chicken salad for in-room dining after a long day on the road, expecting at least a touch of green. I was disappointed. The salad was uniformly white and padded out with anaemic bread croutons and a lot of mayonnaise. Not exactly a healthy, low-calorie option, so

I had requested a wake up alarm for 5:00 AM and airport drop at 5:30AM.   i got the wake up alarm at 5:30 and almost missed my flight due to the delay.  My check-in was slow as they mixed up my reservation with someone else's and hence there was some confusion and delay to check in.   the room itself was average and smelled of old carpet.

But the first room I was checked into was a smoking room and very smelly. They did not even bother to check with me if I was fine with a smoking room. It was changed on request.

There wasn't much choice in food at around 530 pm. Surprising! We were told to wait for buffet which would open at 7 pm. So we just had soup and tea. Not that great.

The wait staff were lovely, however reception when we arrived were not very nice. Then they gave us an extremely outdated room with an old box tv that ruins your eyes from squinting. The room was right near the service elevator so we would get woken up at 4am by the waiters preparing for breakfast. They don't seem to ever turn the music off at night. For the ridiculous price we paid we would expect to get a room in the nicer area of the hotel. The air con was really dirty and you cannot turn it off if you want to turn the lights off at night. This was a problem for me as an asthmatic. Bathroom is nice

  Great Location, just minutes from the domestic airport. They have a free pickup &amp; drop service from the Airport which is very convenient.  Service is good.

The 'Mostly Grills' Restaurant on the Roof top is excellent, offering a great view of Mumbai city and the Airport, And when the weather is good - Dec - April dining there is an amazing experience.  Recommend going early to check out as the number of desk staff is not adequate when multiple people are checking out in the morning.

In this visit, the bathroom stank of urine.  The hotel has a great lobby, but is so full that you will not get a table during breakfast nor can you get a cup of coffee at your table unless you ask for it 3 times.  The room otherwise was okay, not much noise from outside.  My advise - choose another hotel.

  I stayed at the Orchid for business due to it's proximity to the airport and exhibition centre. However if I had to be in this area again, I would go out of my way to find somewhere else to stay. On my first night at the hotel, I had the pleasure of discovering that my sheets were dirty from the previous occupant. I found the service to range from apathetic to rude. I would recommend checking where your room faces, as I ended up looking on to (and listening to) one of the domestic airports runways.

  I generally don't re-review a hotel unless there has been some changes to my previous review, in this case there has been. I recently stayed at the hotel for three days and the biggest improvement in the hotel is the quality of the food in the restaurant. The service is still a bit poor, but the food has definitely improved. As with anything, you find something good and sure enough something bad pops up, in this case it was the so called business centre! Up until this trip I had never used the business centre and will likely never use it again. For a hotel that is basically a three star business hotel, one would think that the computers would be somewhat modernized to bring them into the 21st century and guests would not be required to pay Rs45 for every sheet of print that you

The person in the reception was never fit for reception of a five star hotel, as everybody will like a smiley face there but he cannot smile anyway. My room no. was 238 and i was dishearted to see the way to my room from the reception!! This is a narrow path which i never expected in a five star hotel. Also, this portion of the hotel is shaby, needs renovation. Room wi-fi is excellent in terms of speed but it was not un-interrupted. They gave me a two days password and username which expired on 00:00 midnight though i had requested to allow me upto the next morning. Now a days, wi-fi should be allowed for full time in a five star hotel and many three star allows this. TV signal was very poor

  The Orchid Hotel is ideally located for international travelers. We stayed there back in 2007 and were very impressed by its elegance, excellent food and large comfortable rooms. During our last visit on December 25, 2013, the dinner buffet was still very good and the room was large but lacked the special touches. But what bothered us most was the acrid smell of lemon scented perfume that suffused the room, hallways, and indeed the entire hotel. It burned our eyes and throats, caused headaches and made it very difficult to sleep. This is the reason we rate the hotel now as average. We could not stay there again under these conditions. Surely, management must be aware that many customers are allergic to perfumes and the overpowering amount used will make even non-allergic

Everything about the hotel was welcoming, clean and new. My room was spacious and well appointed, the service excellent and the morning breakfast was delightful. I was continuing on a domestic flight in the morning and the hotel's proximity to the domestic terminal made my departure a breeze. Don't be put off by the approach to the hotel, which feels like you are entering a no-go zone of broken fences, weeds and debris. This is India.

Still, a high-end 4* for a couple thousand less that has better service would be preferred.  The main problem here though, is just management in my opinion.  This place could be really nice even with the old decor and location if it just felt a little more ""together."" Everything seems just a little lazy.

This hotel clearly needs to be refurbished and refreshed by the owners, who are kindly invited to invest into the refurbishing of the rooms and corridors. After first arriving into my room, I went into the bathroom to wash my hands, and found out that the sink was just blocked and stuffy, the water could not be evacuated. Further, the smell of the room was unpleasant, as well as the smell of the air stirred by the air condition. How unpleasant is that ? It was the smell of spoilt and addle ventilation.

If you need to go to the domestic terminal it's a good place to stay. The hotel is nicely designed. If enter it you come to a very spacious hall which is dominated by the waterfall in the middle.  The hotel seems to be always very busy. So Check-in can take some time - and I mean ""some time"". The rooms are equipped well. But you see on every corner that all the stuff is old. Chairs, carpets and so on have stains, dents, chips. The bath is is clean on the surface - when you get closer you find the not so clean spots and older armatures. It looks like there has been almost no maintenance in the past 20

  This hotel is just at walkable distance from mumbai domestic airport. Breakfast buffet has lot of variety in terms of choice. You can take dinner at the terrace roof tops if its not monsoon and can view flights landing and takeoff in domestic airport runway. This is amazing view alongside swimming pool on terrace. There is also restaurant called vindhyas which serves traditional indian food with artist performing with musical instrument. Overall food is better than other hotels in this area of vile parle.

The best part about the hotel is that it is very close to the International airport and a few minutes walk to the Domestic airport, so perfect for business travel. The rooms look a bit dated, but are comfortable. The restaurant where breakfast is served is on the 1st floor and hard to find, the signages are not very helpful. I found at least 4 other guests who were walking around in circles trying to locate it. Having said that, the breakfast was the highlight. A lot of variety - continental, healthy and indian options served. Service was overall very good. The hotel seems to be quite popular as the check in counters were full at 10pm.

The concierge staff are nice and some of the old timers remember the guest and their welcome is nice. The front desk staff turnaround is  more and new faces are seen every few months hence check n method and welcome are remote this should be looked into.  Food is good both Vindhyas and the Mostly Grill on the top floor which has beautiful view of the airport.    The airport drop and pick up service is efficient and considering the mess of Mumbai traffic the transfer time is a boon.  Overall a good hotel to stay which has managed to keep up the standards.

  I travelled to Mumbai on a business visit and stayed at Orchid, Mumbai.  Its proximity to the domestic airport makes it a good choice to stay for business visitors to the city.    Decor in the room is quite dated and old fashioned. A special mention of the TV set, it was an old CRT with very poor sound quality and extremely bad color reproduction on the screen.   I was surprised that Orchid, a 5 Star Hotel have not upgraded the TV sets to LCDs/ LEDs.  There was no Dental Kit in the bathroom, i had to wait for 45 mins and 2 reminders before they delivered the same to my room.  Although the staff have a friendly behavior, the speed of service is lagging.  The Buffet Breakfast was complimentary along with the stay.  I must say that the breakfast was comprehensive and tasted good.

The service was the pits...there was a pregnant lady and a school kid and inspite of requesting for early starters it was served after 50 min . till then some oily papads were kept for munching. The dishes were over-cooked and over- fried in oil, the waiters clueless about the accompaniments with the dishes, pathetic quality of food.The managers were also below the mark.

Service is quite slow but then that is India. The biggest issue if you are using this hotel for business is the appalling wifi. I was unable to use Skype or download or play video.

Room was very spacious, neatly done.   Service at all levels is superb.   Interiors within the room are ok, with an exception the long running wall where TV is placed looks unoccupied for large portion. Some aesthetic painting or showpiece or something else probably could make it look exotic. TV sets also look bit dated with broad frames (plasma style). Not a big issue with this point though.

  My seminar took place at the Orchid Mumbai and hence I stayed there for just 1 night. The proximity to the domestic airport in Mumbai made it an ideal venue.   The moment you enter the Orchid Mumbai Hotel you sense that it is indeed a very busy hotel. The lobby buzzes with activity.   All together I enjoyed the hotel. Here are the highlights;  Pro's; - nice and spacious room and not too noisy - great little detail with the device which allows you to control the electrics of the room from your bedside table (see photo) - the roof-top pool is small, but useful - the roof-top restaurant seemed like a nice setting for a quiet meal - reception staff were efficient and service-minded - breakfast was good,   Con's; - the internet was unstable - impossible at times, fast at other times.

  Of the hotels in close proximity to Mumbai airport, this is possibly the best. The location - down a somewhat dodgy lane - might seem unpretentious, but once you get here (and the airport transfer is efficient), the hotel is quite comfortable. My check-in is smooth and I am escorted to a large, well appointed room with first-rate airconditioning. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is better than adequate and the room fittings, while some distance from being tired, seem a little dated. However, the service standards at this hotel are exceptional and you will tend to overlook the niggles as I did. The coastal restaurant downstairs is exceptionally good and the breakfast spread is good. Overall, it has been a comfortable stay.

But to my surprise the conference room turned out to be excellent choice. I have been to many hotels but the amenities and the services rendered and the food served was outstanding.

  Orchid service is its prompt service &amp; the organic toiletries and inventories provided inside the room. Its a pleasure staying in such a well furnished place.  The best part of the hotel which most of the guests are not aware is the mini museum created by the owner Mr. Vithal Kamat.   I was the lucky one to have the opportunity to see it &amp; it was the gesture of Mr. Kamat who is so humble in nature.

  I have been staying at the Orchid several times a year over the past few years. The new wing has been a good addition. The rooms in this wing look nice and new. The older rooms in the main hotel are old and the carpet smells. The price keeps going up but not as much as some of the other hotels in Mumbai. The food has become ridiculously expensive and the quality is mediocre at best.   Its proximity to the domestic airport and western expressway make it a good choice to stay but it has competitors coming up quickly and successfully.

  This is a comfortable airport hotel of a good standard but I would not rate it as 5 star. The piano player in the lobby in the evening is a nice touch.  I rated it highly for location but that of course all depends on what you want; it is close to the domestic airport, about 15 minutes from the international airport when the traffic is not too heavy, but a long way from the city centre.  The rooftop restaurant is a nice location for dinner but the food is rather average, although a good selection of wines, beers, and cocktails, but the service was also average. Service is the coffee shop was also rather poor - I waited nearly half an hour for a mango lassi!  I have stayed here before and will stay again, it's reasonably priced for standard and location, so don't be too put off

  As soon as you pull into the lot of the Hotel your car gets thoroughly searched and every bag scanned and yourself. I love the security of the hotel and understand why they need to take these precautions due to the earlier Mumbai incident. The hotel is just pure luxury and the water fountain by the elevators is just marvelous. The buffet was really good and was open pretty late. The rooms weren't as I expected but for the price you can expect that.The washroom was way more luxurious than the room ;). The bar downstairs is small and cozy and the music was alright. The Heineken I feel was a bit overpriced compared to Canada. Overall I recommend everyone to go to this hotel if you are visiting Mumbai.

  Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found it very comfortable. The hotel is located close to the Mumbai domestic airport. Its just a 5 minutes drive from airport. International airport is about 15 minutes drive during off peak hours and about 30 minutes drive during peak hours. Pick up and drop facility is good . However i faced a delay in getting the service as all the cars had gone to the airport to drop the guests (peak time)  The staff is courteous and also well groomed which would be expected considering this hotel is a 5 star hotel.  Rooms are spacious. However the furniture gives you a feel of the hotel  being old. Also The Tv are the old fashioned CRT tv and not plasma or LED ( atleast in the basic rooms)   Bathrooms are spacious and well equipped with toiletries.

  I stayed here for three days for business meetings most of which were in the Western suburbs of Mumbai. The hotel worked due to its proximity to both domestic and international airports and the Western Express highway that links a large part of the western suburbs.  The hotel interior looks dated like it was from the 80's. You can tell this from the colour of the carpet in the lobby to the wood panels all over the ground floor. It feels like the space needs to be spruced up.  The rooms in the new wing are spacious but again lack a personality. They look a bit fuddy duddy even though everything in the space is new. Bathrooms are spacious with a separate bath and rain shower. Wake-up calls were precise and friendly which worked especially because I had an early start to the day.

I was not very happy with the quality of food provided which I got when I ordered for in-room dining. The food was somehow way too spicy even though I had ordered for pretty standard Indian meal. I had one dinner at the roof top restaurant/ bar at this hotel and was impressed!! We sat at one of the corner table just next to the roof boundary and it gave full view of the airport. We could see the airplanes planes parked, taking off....This restaurant had good food and also some good live music!!!

  We stayed at Hotel Orchid,Mumbai as we had heard it was good and also had expected Amazing service from the hotel. Our expectations were wrong as nothing could be described as good service.My sister and mother were staying at the hotel alone. The biggest turn-down was that the rooms were not clean.Late night, One of my family members weren't well and needed medicines. They asked the authorities at the reception to please give us one of the taxis parked outside so we could get medicines and also as it was late night so ladies going out in an unknown areas was unsafe. They refused even though we could see taxis standing outside and just taking rounds around the fountain and parking. When asked to get medicines for us they refused to get that either.

  Excellent location near the Domestic airport with complimentary pick-up and drop off at both Domestic &amp; International airports. The service is polite and prompt. Check-in at the hotel (particularly in the evenings) can be chaotic with no queues and the attitude of the guests to not wait for their turn. Recent change to free Wi-Fi is a good addition. Food was good with plenty of choice. The 'live' cooking counters give it a personal touch.

  The hotel takes advantage if its location being close to Mumbai airport. It also offers many good services complimentary which are generally chargeable in such hotels, including WiFi. The food is good, breakfast is elaborate and they offer wide range of selection. Rooms are a little small but can't expect larger in an airport hotel. Complimentary airport pickup and drop is another feature. Thumbs up from me.

Complimentary pick up and drop to airport is provided to all who have confirmed reservations.The lobby is impressive but overall the hotel does give an impression of being slightly cramped in terms of space.The door leading to the newly added section is very small and unimpressive. The rooms are clean and adequately sized. The in house dining menu is definitely overpriced. The area for the buffet is also somewhat cramped and the selection is limited. Pls also remember to come early for check out as it really takes  a long time. Likewise for check in. I wonder why they have not taken any action to improve this long waiting time at the reception.

  This ""eco-friendly"" hotel is nice inside with nice enough rooms and a beautiful main dining room overlooking the foyer.  The biggest problem is the distance from downtown - not a prob if you just need a place to stay on your way to another city since it is near the domestic airport.  But it is a real trek to the sights of Bombay.  Another negative is the mediocre quality of the food - in particular, stay away from the restaurant on the rooftop. A major positive - the staff are generally very warm and kind (not all) and if you have any travel needs ask for Pradeep at the travel desk!  He performed several miracles for us.

The front office was quite gracious to give me a room earlier than the scheduled day stay time of check-in.  The room was good, no issues and complaints at all. Had breakfast at the Boulevard, a just enough spread, but was quite sumptuous. Had a call from Guest Relations around 1430 hrs about my check out time and the lady Lubna said it would be half charge extra.

  The most important thing about this hotel you need to know is that its right next to the domestic airport so if you need that location this is your hotel. I found the hotel very clinical almost as if the staff did not need to be warm and caring as the business was going to flow in due to the location anyways. Ihave stayed here a few times to take my connecting international flights. The rooms are functional with everything you need but nothing to write home about. Food is average like any big hotel too. I am quite sure most people who stay here do so for the location. Dont think there is any other big reason for you to pick this place though that is big enough if you need that location.

My enjoyment of this hotel, other hotels, and of Mumbai generally, was slightly compromised by the insufferable humidity. The air-conditioned hotel is agreeable, but the rooftop restaurant, which is outside (fortunately covered to protect customers from the monsoon), is very humid. This is not a criticism of the hotel, but something that new visitors to Mumbai (and possibly other parts of India too) should be aware of.

I have stayed here at many occasions and each time the experience has been as good as the last time! Food is quite OK in the main course, but the breakfast is out of the world! My favorite is the Upma as rightly mentioned by one of the reviewers here. Rooms are spacious, quiet and cozy. The environment friendly initiatives are visible at various places inside the rooms, like encouraging you to drink the safe potable water from the taps, reusing the towels and many more. Overall, one of the better hotels to stay in the otherwise crowded Mumbai.

  The main benefit of this hotel is it's proximity from the domestic airport. You can literally walk to the hotel once you have landed. The food is good and this hotel is known for it. It has 3 restaurants which offer multiple cousins. The appealing feature of the hotel is it's rooftop view of the airport. For time killers, its the best option to sit at the rooftop with a glass of beer and watch planes taking off and landing. The new extension to the hotel is fresh and rooms are good. The only pain point is rooms in the main hotel need major renovation. The wood smells bad at times and can give you headache and bad sleep. You might even need to ask them to spray a lot of room freshener. The swimming pool is ozonized but is quite small. Overall it's a 3-4 star experience and not a

  The hotel is almost adjacent to the domestic airport. The only service worth remembering was the airport pick up. You almost seem to get lost in the vastness of the hotel. Staff were busy with their own chores so therewere hardly any greetings. Although this a a full service hotel, most of the things were in self service mode. Rooms, toiletries, buffet breakfast was good. The hotel has supposedly got a 5 star tag (heavens know why). Room service pricings were out of the world.  Book yourself only if you must and have deep pockets to splurge.

  We have stayed at this hotel several times over the past few years, when flying in and out of the domestic airport and always enjoyed our stay.   However, this year the standard seems to have dropped considerably.   It started badly with a long wait for the pre-booked transfer and was followed by a scramble for the buffet at around 10.30pm, where we competed with a crowd of noisy young men, who gave no thought to any of the other guests.   The quality of the food and service was not up to the previous standard. I had hoped that this was a one off, but speaking to a friend afterwards, she also confirmed that she had had a similar experience when staying there the previous year. The reception staff were helpful and the room clean and comfortable though the bathrooms are probably

  A very convenient hotel for the frequent travelers.  It is very close to the domestic airport.   The food is good.  Bar is even better.  There is a roof top restaurant which is very good for a lonely visitor. One can watch the whole airport from there.  A live band plays there as well as in the bar.  The buffet is very good. A good combination of east and west. The spa is okay. The room is quite spacious.  The room service is prompt and good. The staff is very courteous and eager to help with a smile. On two occasions when I was there, it took a long time to check out in the morning because at that time a large group was checking out and there was a long queue.

You can check-in at 9am &amp; by 6pm you can check-out. This way the rate is lower &amp; much better for using this facility in hotel only during Day Time.

Wide range of food on offer at buffet breakfast.   We had an executive room - for 2 adults and a child. Which was fine. We had no problems with noise, as reported below. Had a quick and easy check in / check out;  Airport pickup and return was taken care of by the hotel - took a few minutes to locate the driver on arrival, but that is aprt of the mayhem of Mumbai airport. Look out for a bright pink people carrier. Very quick and comfortable.  Used the pool in the morning - lovely big childrens section to the pool. Also a Mexican [?!?] restaurant on roof top.

  Stayed for a week in Orchid hotel. The rooms are relateively small for a 5 star hotel so once you enter your room, you might feel that it is a 3 star hotel. Everything you order in hotel is insanely overpriced. The dinner buffet cost Rs1600 per person as compared to Rs800-Rs900 in other well known 5 star hotels.The WIFI is complementary but you can connect only one device to it. So in a day if you use Wifi on your laptop, you can NOt connect to wifi using your smartphone. There are people who will listen to your complaints but no one will address your complaints.

The room was very nice and the bed was excellent.  I asked for a wake up call which was prompt on time.  Pick up and drop at the airport was complimentary.  One advantage of this hotel is that it is all most in the domestic airport so no chance of being delayed in traffic.

I was charged 500 for the beer which is all well and good, and then when I looked at the receipt I saw I was charged an insane amount for some kind of alcohol tax as well as a ""service charge"" Since when do you have to pay a service fee for a take away beer? I let my friend drink a miniature Glenfiddich from the mini bar and upon check out, after all the takes and fees, I was charged nearly 2000 Rupees for this tiny little bottle!!!

  While on business trip to catch an early morning flight it is essential to stay close to Airport at a reasonable cost for people who are out of Mumbai; which this hotel satisfies. There is a coach from the hotel to the airport and you do not need to book a taxi for this which runs every 15 minutes. Food is healthy and tasty with quick services in room or in the restaurant. Note the checkout time and you may room charges if you can adjust to the flight time. Rooms at higher level are quieter, but the air traffic noise is always a bother. The services are innovative and pleasing.

  We were directed to the Orchid hotel after our flight was cancelled. At 10000INR a night we thought we would voi the worse as we travelled with 4 kids including one infant.  From the start, they put us on the first floor next to a private party which made it unbearable to even be in our room. Afte much arguing, they agreed to move us to the 6f which was fine but you could still hear the beating of the 1fl party. Then we had lunch - big mistake : the food was very expensive and at time truly disgusting. Our 12 yo son ended up sick the whole night, which without giving details he could attribute to the food he had there. Finally, whichever request to the reception would take 2 to 3 hours to fulfill, or would be simply ignored. A place to avoid at any price!

When you book, if you are lucky you can participate in an auction to get the price you seek but will lose all if you cancel after winning.

  Mumbai is a place which can offer all sorts of accommodation. To search the right one hence becomes a tricky task. I too have been at many hotels of different categories. This one stands apart due to its location. Very near to the air port, just off the Western express highway still the lane on which it is located is quite with nice hotels in the neighbourhood. Food is excellent here, if you like the right proportions of ingredients, i.e. not bland or not too spicy just authentic. Breakfast too has good options to choose from especially for the buffet. Overall you can have a relaxing experience in the hustle bustle of Mumbai. It should be your bay in Mumbai!

  My husband and I wanted to stay at a hotel near mumbai domestic airport as we had a 10 hour layover before our international flight. Check in was no problem and we had a very comfortable non smoking room on the third floor. Considering the proximity to the domestic airport and the busy road outside we couldnt hear a peep. The bed was very comfortable, with tea and coffee making facilities. Power Shower was also good. They have a buffet restaurant which we ate at cos us 550 rupees each, which we didnt think was bad considering its a five star. Had a good selection of food, it wasnt to my taste, the curries were just over spicy, which almost everything else being rather bland. But hey if you are ear to while some hours and get a meal before you fly its good value.

  Arrived very late at night. For some reason, as I was part of a group, my name was not in their system but on a separate list on a paper printout. After a couple unpleasant minutes, I had the idea to mention that I was part of a gorup and the reception clerk found my name. Went to my room, which I found rather old and unattractive. The floor was stained and there were no slippers; had the feeling I had to keep my socks on. The minibar fridge was completely empty so I opted for a complimentary bottle of water. I spent another night a few days after. A member of the group told me that his room in the new wong was much better, so I asked for one. In fact the room was nicer and wider.

I told them several times that this was unacceptable. Typically, they kept on saying ' You are right sir but....'.

  I landed in Mumbai as always without a hotel booking and was turned away by Ibis as it was full. I checked into Orchid and was pleasantly surprised by the service there. The hotel has an old school charm to it. The coffee shop on the first floor is beautiful, well stocked and totally worth a visit. It is ideal for early morning breakfast meetings. I was given a room in a far off corner which was a bit of a concern as I was travelling alone. But the room itself was nice and comfortable. Internet was painfully slow and I felt like I had been cheated. A thumbs up for the room service. I was on Navratra fasts and the delicious sabutdana khichdi kept me sane and happy.

  This is supposed to be an ecologically sensitive 5 star hotel and indeed I was very impressed when I stayed here for the first time about a decade ago. But the hotel is growing a bit long in the tooth. Age shows in the scuffed soft furnishings, the stained corridor walls, scratched furniture etc. But the hotel still excels in many areas.  Location: Just about 1 km from the exit doors of Mumbai's Domestic Terminals 1A, 1B and 1C. Max 10mins by the hotel's complimentary pick-up/drop-off service. Infact in a crunch situation you can walk it in about 15 mins. That means its very convenient if you have a flight to catch at an odd hour. But it also means a good 1.5hr drive to downtown Mumbai. Besides, you cant really go for a stroll around the hotel, its a congested locality.  Rooms:

First impressions, as I was left to open each of the glass doors to enter the lobby and hold it open for the doorman, were that service was a little lacking.  Hotel reception is open, very high ceiling, marble floor, waterfall etc, so at that point I thought it might still be okay.  Checkin took an age, maybe waiting for 10 minutes despite the 2 desk staff only dealing with 1 person each during my wait.  Staff were slightly aloof and unengaging.  My room, a Deluxe, 326, was okay.  Lighting system etc was controlled from a stupid control console next to the bed, turning a light on in the middle of the night was a hit and miss

  It was 2006 when I visited Orchid for the first time . It was very impressive those days. Neat and clean and classy. Now after five years the same hotel looks sadly outdated. It is still neat and clean but that's the end of it. Time seems to have been frozen half a decade back.  Its location is the biggest plus point for Orchid. The domestic airport takes about three minutes from the lobby. But, if they do not upgrade it will be real difficult to maintain their only USP, the geographical vicinity with the domestic terminal as Hotel like Subah International are also very near and may well be breathing on their shoulder. This does not look or even feel like a five star property at all. Just okay and average.

  The hotel is located very close to the domestic airport - walkable by distance, but the road is really nasty - so better take a cab/auto. The hotel lobby is impressive with a tall water feature (fantastic). The rooms seem a little old - clean though, but could do with some renovation. The breakfast buffet is quite large. The fitness center is nice - the pool area doubles up as a bar in the evenings - so pretty unusable in the evenings. If you book on their website, don't make the booking for the rate shown. They send you an email asking you for the price you are willing to pay - and you can easily get a rate about 500-100 cheaper than the lowest rate on their website. I wouldn't call the hotel 5 star, but it is probably the best hotel close to the domestic airport.

  Orchid brand is synonymous to luxurious hospitality and Mumbai's Orchid Hotel lives up to this reputation. The property is plush and staff is helpful. I wanted to take print of my eticket after midnight and even though the business center was closed, the shift manager gladly helped out.   We had availed of its pickup service from International Airport and drop down to the domestic airport and this was smoothly managed by the Hotel. Given the horrible Mumbai traffic, Hotel's proximity to domestic airport is a big boon. Takes only 5 minutes to reach domestic airport.

The hotel is quite compact and does not have large open spaces as it is located centrally.

  The Orchid advertises itself as a five star ecotel hotel.  What that is supposed to mean to you as a guest was not clear to me even after staying there.  Being in Mumbai where space is at a premium, you do not get a sense of space while staying there that you get on watching the pictures of the hotel on its website.  Being located near the domestic airport, it is nestled between other hotels and you may end up having your window face the backside of another hotel and you would rather not draw the curtains for a look outside. The amenities in the room are not matching a five star.  Only plain tea bags are there – any other kind of tea is not available even on request.

When I called, they had no idea, and sent me to the breakfast hall (which was reasonable, had I not been given the run around.)

  When we reached near the Hotel we could not find the parking, Immediately we saw someone was coming towards us from the Hotel and he showed us the way inside and taken our car for parking. We went at the reception likely there were rooms available for us. We did not waste our time at the receiption they managed very well.  We appreciate the kind of Hospitality &amp; the food.  We have stayed at few hotels in India whenever we go for a holiday pn vaction. Few of them are not so clean. But this hotel was very clean.  Friendly service that makes it worth staying in this hotel. The  staff are  just  right level and they  make you feel at home.  Food was excellent. Specially Crab dish with shezwan sauce. We liked it very much. We will surely visit again.

  Stayed fora business conference in the hotel and considering its 5 star rating and the ecotel tag, was a complete downer.  The carpet in the room was smelly and the decor is quite dated (not nice either). The only great thing about the hotel is its location, it is next to domestic airport and easy reach as on highway. So whether u wanna go to South or suburbs, its easy to reach.  In the name of ecotel they dont provide you newspaper and dont change your sheets. Thats the only thing I found was saving energy, which seemed just like a marketing gimmick.  Restaruant is good and service is decent, but the price that they are charging is a rip off against what u get.

  the hotel situated near the domestic airport is very convenient for short stays, meetings etc. But as it is near the airport it is always crowded...also the lobby is small.

The food is good...the staff are very courteous. but the hotel needs one more renovation..it looks jaded.

  I have been staying at this hotel many times during the past 2 years, owing to my requirements of short stay. I usually have a day stay since I come from outside of mumbai, and than am enroute to abroad in the evening. So in that sense it is a stop over for me, and I usually stay not more than 8 hours. So I am really not able to get the best out of the money i spend because i do not manage to use all the facilities of the hotel like others who usually make an overnight or more than one day halt. Having said that I prefer the ambience of the hotel. The checkin is usually smooth and hassle free, unless there is a huge rush of guests. the front desk is efficient, but not very friendly and warm. This can be improved. There drop and pick up facility for the airport is efficient. I

  I had checked into the hotel on 3rd which my office had booked for one night stay. Before checking in the counter clerk swiped my debit card for Rs 11000/- and told me that this is theusual practice and that while checking out it will be suitably adjusted. Next day while checking out I presumed he will adjust the money already credited and I need to pay only Rs 1000 or so as additional expense. Instead he again swiped my card for Rs 12 582 and told me that this is the usual practice and that the advance paid is automatically cancelled. However mybank still shows debits for Rs 11000 and Rs 12532. My office tried to reach the hotel but they are not returning the calls. I think this is absolutely unethical and I am intending to proceed legally.

  If you need to be near the airport, then this is a good option. With traffic in Mumbai, driving to most locations take much longer than necessary! The decor in the hotel is set with eco-friendly materials (incl the slippers in the room!). While the service in the room is good, the food could be better. There is a restaurant on the mez level that has a good buffet. However, be warned that the restaurant is usually packed in the mornings by business travelers, so you might want to plan for a little more time.

The rooms were nicely arranged before we arrived. So all we had to do was set up the AV system and we were ready to start. As usual, the front office area and the lounge with the artifical waterfall is always serene and peaceful in the morning. It does get noisy as it gets busy during the day but one can always find a nice corner to read the newspaper or a book or just snooze for a while.   Going back to the meeting rooms, the stationary had been put in place and arrangement for tea/coffee had been kept ready. Water was served after the meeting started, however we had to call them for water over and

  I stayed at the Orchid Hotel on a business trip. I had left rather abruptly and it was the season time and I was unable to get a room in any of the descent hotels in the Island City (Mumbai) so ended up staying at the Orchid which is right next to the Airport at Ville Parle. I had to go the next day to the city and it took me over two hours in a cab!! It took even longer coming back because of the jams on the highway! I know it was probably not the best thing to stay so far off from the city but on short notice there was little else I could do. But it took me only five minutes to reach the airport the next morning so it was tolerable!  OK enough about the traveling and location, the hotel on its own is an absolute gem and the service is excellent. The rooms were lovely and the

  From being repeatedly woken during both nights by noisy staff cleaning rooms and shouting to each other, to waiters in the restaurant who studiously ignore the customers so that to even get a cup of tea you need to get up and go and ask them, staff walking straight into my room without knocking, to the dirty bathroom and inability to even replace the shampoo, this hotel was a disappointment. Reception upon arrival was excellent, then everything went downhill; I could not even get online because the person who gave out the password was not around, nobody else could do it, so I had to wait till he eventually turned up at his convenience. Whoever gave this place 5 stars must have been giving them away with cornflakes boxes. The service is appalling.

  Before I get into specifics, I'm rating The Orchid Hotel as if it were a 5-Star hotel (which they, themselves, advertise that they are). I stayed at the Orchid Hotel for 5 nights as part of a business trip in February.   First, the positives: 1.) It's close to the airport. If you get in early in the morning (most international flights do), you're not going to want to be far from the airport. 2.) Breakfast has a HUGE buffet, with plenty of options on it to cater to the pickiest of eaters. 3.) Our travel agent didn't book our hotel for the night we arrived, and we didn't catch it, but they were able to find a room for us. 4.) Requests that you make for anything from your room - more water, extra towels, etc. - are met VERY quickly. We called them the ninja service while we were

  Well what can I say. This hotel is right near the airport, I must admit I thought I would have trouble with aircraft noise, but nothing could be further from the truth. Even on the roof top open air restaurant there was no problem. All the staff were very helpful and attentive. The rooms were excellent! I could not say more. The 24 hour buffet restaurant had a good choice of both Indian and western dishes. I could not have asked for better! However my only beef is again having to pay for Internet access! why do they do this! Coming to Mumbai? then stay here you will not be dissapointed.

The rooms are usually very clean &amp; cosy although you might not get a good view through the window. I have always had a view over the airport runway.  The utilities provided like the slippers, gown etc are of a very good quality and ather to the eco-friendly atmosphere.  The tariff at the time of stay was INR 8500 which was quite decent against heir rack rates of INR 19000.  Overall I would definetly recommend this hotel for stay either on a business or personal

  The best thing about this hotel is that it is the nearest to the Santa Cruz airport (just about 3-5 mins ride). In fact that lets them offer a free airport pick up. This also saved me the last minute jitters while checking out as I did not have to unnecessarily rush out.  Things better at this place: roof-top pool (good for Sunday morning swim) and break fast.   Not so good: Dim lights in room (guess that's same in every hotel); dis-functional door keys.  The fact that it is near to the airport might not always be good. In case you want to travel to South Bombay for business then traffic will take away all that time that you saved by staying near the airport.  Overall I have had pleasant experience in staying here and have been back few times.

  First of all, this Hotel is more expensive then it might seem at the first place .... and it hit´s business travellers where it hurts the most: expenses. Wanting a drink or having something out of the minibar? Your about to pay twice as much as in comp. hotels.  You need Internet/Wlan? get ready for serious 10 Dollars for 4h usage rights. That is just overdoing it. In my current hotel I pay about 2 Dollars per day and the Hotel is even more upscale then the Ecotel. Since I am this time travelling privatly, this is was ""hurts"" me the most.

  We were on standby for a flight and did not make it on the flight so had to find a hotel for the night.  We went to the arrivals hotel desk at the international airport.  The guy there who was employed by the airport (as I understand) was suspiciously pushing this place on us, ever though it was at the domestic airport.  He called and got a rate of 6000 INR not including tax.  Other true five stars (this claims on its sign it's five star) had rates of 8000-9000 INR so we thought well ok we only need a night lets stay there.  After the guy started filling out the paperwork he called them back to confirm and they now said 7000 INR.  But then he went on how it was much better than the other hotels nearby and how much people love it and ask to be booked there again.  So we agreed.

  The Orchid - An Ecotel Hotel as it is popularly known , is definitely a hotel which can be trusted just on its popularity !! .. I am a student and i had been to this hotel in the last year ... Being a member of their Elite Members' Scheme , i was entitled to certain vouchers which gave us a reduction on the total bill amount .. But irrespective of that , the Sunday Bruch is a succulent treat that must be given a try !! ... Priced at just Rs. 900 ( including taxes ) , it provides an excellent variety of sea-food , with dishes like Prawn Cocktail , Fish Grill , Fish in BBQ sauce , etc. But however , the only negative aspect of the brunch is the ambience .. A little too cozy , and a little too dull , provides the only two disheartening factors .. However , the stay was more than

  Located in Vile Parle I found the hotel to be really cost effective and an A Class Business Hotel. The hotel is quite close to airport and has regular cabs plying between the hotel and the airport.  The best part was that the sensibility to serve beverages in the cab for guests who just arrived after a long flight. The facilities like express check out and for a food fanatic like me who gets hunger pangs in the middle of night all the arrangements were made.  Above being a champion of environmental issues the hotel is the only ecotel hotel in India using recycled paper and lot of other environment friendly material.  Overall good value for money and an excellent business hotel ... I would love to come back to the hotel

  I actually cannot believe that the other people who wrote reviews wrote so favorably!  To be honest, the Orchid is a nice 3 star hotel, absolutely NOT 5 as is touted in all its literature.  It would be a good value at about 70 USD per night, but is priced almost at 5 star prices.  The gin and tonics (sans lime) are more expensive here than they are at the Intercontinental Hotel on Marine Drive, where all the rich and famous hang out.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who was interested in value.

  We spent a night there, and thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. The hotel's ""fountain"" in the it's center was beautiful, the rooms were clean and well-appointed, and the service was prompt almost all the time.  The food was a disappointment. We ate a the Boulevard, the 24-hour restaurant, and the Indian restaurant, and neither were as good as claimed. ""Average"" pretty much described the overall quality. For example, the lamb stew was not good, the hot-and-sour soup was okay, the tandoori sandwich was above average.  Breakfast was a big, big disappointment. Limited variety, below average south Indian fare, and average continental fare. Along with an egg stand, there were just 3-4 accompaniments, none of which were good.  The only good dish (and *not* very good), was the thai red

  Orchid at Domestic Airport, Mumbai, India has been a landmark in the city.  We stayed there for 1 night while living in the same city and took pleasure of spending quality time with my family.   My 6 years old daughter enjoyed the ambience and facility of the room. Room has all required facility with all accessories in Ecotel style.  While food was typical of 5* style (I mean as typical Indian, we are used to spiecy food but here it was general taste that suites most people) what I liked most was servings that was offered. Good quality and quantity.   Next day morning we experienced Gym and Swimming pool along with Steam and Sauna. As in accordance with size of the hotel, Gym is of mid size but has all required equipments for a regular gym freak.  Over all, enjoyed the stay

  What one looks in while staying in Hotel ? Its ambience, quality food, nice interior, good facilities, convenient transportation and communication system, etc. Orkid has made all of this happened at a single place. They created a petrified garden on the second or third floor of the hotel. Wifi is available everywhere in the hotel. Hotel is just 2 minutes walk from the domestic airport. Other posh places in the surrounding includes Hotel Sahara star and Hyatt. Orkid, itself is a five star hotel. Automated light control system in its rooms is its distinguishing future. They serve full-course meal in afternoon and evening. I am mad about the desserts they serve there. extremely amazing. These hotel is extremely recommended from my side.

  Stayed at the Orchid in Mumbai for 2 nights with my family of 2 adults and 2 kids. The checkin was swift and well orchestrated. The room was of a very high standard and everything was spic and  and in top class condition. We were given a room looking into the central atrium. Having peeked at the outside i was thankful we got the interior view.  The AC worked well and the bathroom was very well appointed. Definitely of 5 star standard. the room lighting was also of very high standard. The lobby and communal areas were very pleasing and the central water feature a real eye catcher.  Had my afternoon meals at the central atrium located cafe and it was of a very good standard. The lamb biryani was superb. But strangely no childrens menu, had a long conversation with the manager

  The hotel is magnificent and I have experienced such service before, but not in this part of the world. Restaurants are really good, indian cuisine. Room service was very good as reception desk, too. I was satisfied with breakfast.  Hotel is situated in the street, where it is not recommended to walk alone. But many taxi-drivers want to serve you, driving you all - day for 20-30$. This is a good choice for hotel, but I cannot remember how much I paid for room.

  I travelled with my husband who was over on business and having read previous reviews we were a little dubious of the hotel, but were pleasantly surprised.  The staff were helpful and attentive and the food in all the hotel restaurants was excellent.  We especially like the restaurant just of the lobby, Visnjays (I think is how to spell it).  Anyway the food, decor and ambiance were terrific here and the live traditional musicians were a hit.  The staff made super recommendations for side orders and we couldn't fault anything.  Our room was clean and spacious, the view wasn't great, but that would be difficult to achieve in the area around an airport.  The hotel organised a car for me, to take me around the tourist areas and the following day I had a fabulous massage in the

  I spent one night here, arriving in Mumbai on my way to Bangalore the next morning.  I was assigned an ""interior"" looking room, i.e. on the atrium. It is not my favorite so I asked to change rooms, and was rudely told that could not be done. It was late and I had an early flight so I let it go. Everything in the hotel is a little bit rundown and could use a good scrubbing or polishing. Room was smelly and bed was hard.  I was up very early for a morning flight, and even as one of the first breakfast guests, the buffet already looked stale. I had toast only. Location is excellent if you are flying into the international or domestic terminals.

  We stayed in the orchid hotel on arrival and departure from Mumbai airport. The hotel isn't cheap, but then nothing decent is in Mumbai. This was cheaper than most of the hotels of this standard in the area. The service is wonderful, from the pick up at the airport( make sure you let them know), which is complementary ,to the quick check -in and the restaurant/room service. Both visits we were given a double, nonsmoking , quite room as requested. The hotel is actually very quite considering how close it is to the airport. The food at the roof top restaurant is expensive, but delicious. We can recommend the Indian cuisine, but they also have a selection of international meals. The cafe on the first floor also had good food, which we ordered. They also have a very good buffet. The

  My husband and I stayed here at the start and end of our holiday with Goa sandwiched in between.  I should have realised that all that glitters is not gold!  When we arrived we were subjected to a painstakingly long booking in process. The door staff  were overly insistent on taking our cases to our room even though we were more than capable of wheeling two small cases into the lift. Although the room was well presented it had a very musty smell and the bathroom was well stocked, the smell off stale urine was enough to strip the varnish from my nails.  The second visit was as described above. Whilst booking in we requested a twin room but ended up being shown to a double. The case toting porter releasing his vice like grip on our cases went off to sort it. 10 minutes later we

  This hotel is a complete waste of money. When I arrived at the international airport terminal, there was no agent to meet me as planned. My name was on a hotel sign but there was no agent around. He finally turned up after a sweltering 15 minutes. Check-in was fine and I was told I was being upgraded to an Executive Suite, despite the fact I had actually booked one, thus the 'upgrade' offer was a complete con-trick. The suite was fine but there was no basket of fruit as promised. All the lights and air conditioning switches are operated from a bedside control unit, except for the bathroom light. I woke up at 4am and switched on the bathroom light. But then I could not get it to switch off again and it was impossible to get back to sleep with this very bright light. I rang

  Was here for business.  The Orchid is not recommended for tourists, as there is not much around it and taxi rides are about 45 min mininum.  It takes at least an hour and a half to the main tourist areas around the India Gate.  In terms of business amenities, the internet access was not free, and two guys came to install on my computer in the room- not so convenient or private, but decent service.  The gym was very small, only a few machines.  Pool was depressing.  Maybe it was nice 10 years ago, but not what one would consider 5 star.  It had a strange metal grating over it, I would guess that is for an awning for the summer.  You must reach the pool by stairs, which could be a problem for handicapped.  Service was good, but not at a level of 5 star.  People tried very hard,

  My flight was delayed, and the airline put me up at the Orchid.  I am an easy going traveller, so I was tolerant to their many unprofessional elements, like the dried up cheese on the buffet, the croissants that tasted like they just came out of a freezer, and their generally poor attempt to prepare Western foods.  I also was tolerant of their pretending to be a ""green"" hotel, as I am in  the hotel business and am an environmentalist, and they showed no  signs of treading lightly on the Earth.  But, if they want to put up that front, than so be it.  Maybe, somewhere behind the scenes, they might choose to be a little bit more green, which is good enough.  But, where this hotel failed to an incredible degree was in the service.  The staff there is absolutely horrible.  I've spent

  The Orchid is a very nice hotel. Its location is perfect; of you want somewhere close to the Airports. On the other hand its locations can be a disadvantage if you want to go down town. Even though the location is close to the airports, there are not that many big shops or eating places outside the hotel. In addition some taxis may not take you all the way to south Mumbai.  The rooms in this hotel are really of good quality. They are big, clean and comfortable. The dining in this hotel is very good. There are many options, and there are regular rooftop barbeques! The swimming pool is also located on the rooftop. Once you are on the roof top balcony, you can see the airport and planes landing and taking off. It has the best views of the airport/runways in my opinion. There is
