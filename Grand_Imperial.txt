  We stayed at grand imperial agr afor 2 nights during our trip to Agra. The property oozed grandeur and took us back in time -100years when the peroperty was built. Comfortable and spacious room, clean lenin and efficient  room service. Beautifully kept lawns and open areas for spilling out into the property to enjoy nature. The only draw back was that the restaurant wasnt on full fledgit due to the post covid scenes and the food wasnt that great. but overall a great experience to stay right int he centre of the city and find peace.

  I had the pleasure of staying in the Grand Imperial for Diwali 2020 and I could not have been happier. My room was absolutely gorgeous with a front and a back door - the back door leads to the beautiful pool area. The gardens are stunning. The staff super friendly and helpful under trying times. The food was basic, but homey and perfect and super tasty. I loved every second I was there and after suffering at the great monuments and their insane ticket policies, it was pure joy and delight to come back to the Grand Imperial. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

4,Nice Hotel, November 2020,Abhijit Baghel,3.0,"<q class=""IRsGHoPm"">

  I visited the hotel last weekend. Location is difficult to fine on GSP. Had to ask few people and then reached the location. After entering the premise the first impression was not good, since the hotel did not match anything as they have shown in their pics. Entire hotel lawn was covered with marriage stage decoration due to which the look and feel of the hotel was all compromised and it looked nothing like it is in their websites.  At the time of checkin, Sahaya was very courteous and she helped in quick check in. The room was good and matches to what has been shown in the photos and it does give you that feel of a heritage property. The hotel does need restoration but considering the pandemic times I think they have been managing well since they have just started operating
 </>
 < class=""_1M-1YYJt"">
  again.  Biggest disappointment was the food in this hotel. Their restaurant is closed for lunch &amp; dinner so they offer room service with limited options. The food quality that we had ordered in the room did not match the rates that they have quoted for lunch or dinner.   Restaurant was opened in the morning for breakfast. It had a good royal feel and I realized then when working at their full capacity it would have looked more classier. For breakfast the options were limited but whatever was offered was good. I had travelled with a 4 year kid so he could eat that breakfast so full marks to breakfast given the limitations within which the hotel is operating.  Another disappointment was hot water timings. Probably this is the first time that I have visited a hotel wherein they have mentioned that hot water timings are only between 5-11 AM. In today's world when a basic 2-3 star hotel also offers 24 hours hot water supply it is hard to understand this policy for the hotel.  Probably if we would have visited the property in the regular times then the experience might have been different the benefit of which I have reflected in the ratings. But my current experience wasn't outstanding!!

  The Grand Imperial ,Agra home to one of one of the Seven Wonders of the World: The Taj Mahal.

The Grand Imperial offers lavish homely original heritage accommodation in the heart of Agra. The hotel features stunning British colonial architecture, an outdoor swimming pool, and a rooftop terrace offering views of the iconic Taj Mahal.

  The Grand Imperial is housed in a heritage building from Indian colonial times and price quality seemed quite good when we booked it. The hotel building itself is charming, rooms are nice and well sized, the staff is extremely courteous and welcoming....it is all worth the money you spend and definitely 4 star. I loved the old paintings they have too. But somehow I was disappointed as several factors stop it from being ‚Äúwow‚Äù.  - The lift: built onto the old building, it is a hideous brown glass addition which ruins the look when you first walk in. - The hotel boasts the oddest assortment of photos I have ever seen. They look old but clearly show that the photographer had no idea about photography and lack charm and add no value.  - Lighting: This is terrible throughout the hotel

  This is a very nice hotel, don't misunderstand, BUT it is a bit far from the Taj Mahal and requires transport for everywhere. The hotel has a british imperial feel with Indian details but is more hotel than indian experience. The food is very nice and the music at dinner create a wonderful atmosphere. Breakfast is abundant and varied. THey have a fun free service of Henna tattoos for hands and feet in the garden in the afternoons and the young lady is marvelous - very talented. The rooms unfortunately do not have quite enough light or air as they are set back in off a long open corridor but they are full of atmosphere and have AC so if you need a place to sleep while in agra this is sufficient.

  I have stay in this hotel for 2 night and it was amazing experience. This hotel is almost 100 year old and you can't feel it once you are in room because everything is so well maintained. Staff were in talking. Room is huge and bathroom is one of the biggest bathroom I have find in any hotel. Just step out from room and you will in garden and swimming pool. Ask for ground floor rooms.

  A totally enchanting hotel - far away from the glitz of modern hotels - which of course have their place in today's world - but if one appreciates the quiet elegance and beauty of a bygone era then this place is for you.  The service is amazing and gracious and a very good selection of Indian and western food is available. Looking at the history of this colonial hotel , it has had quite a few influential and famous people stay there including Prime Minister Nehru and the last Viceroy of India Mountbatten. There are many pictures on the walls that attest to this.  This hotel is very comfortable and evocative of a time gone by. Will certainly stay again.

  This beautiful heritage hotel makes you feel like you've gone back in time. So calm and tranquil with beautiful gardens.    This place is about atmosphere, history and Indian hospitality not mod cons.  I loved the old fashioned brass padlocks on the doors....no keycards here!  The rooms where authentic and beautiful.  The manager showed us around some of the other rooms and explained to us how much research went into choosing and sourcing furniture and accessories that would be in keeping with the hotel.   The rooms are a little dark, as probably when the hotel was built they wanted to minimise the heat impact (pre air conditioning), however this did not hinder our enjoyment one bit.   This is not a shiny, blingy usb ports everywhere place... This is a authentic elegance! I

  Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Check in was very welcoming. The hotel gro7nd are beautiful.The rooms are absolutely gorgeous, truly a treat for the senses. The pool was lovely and refreshing. Lounge chairs around the pool are relaxing. Had one massage at the spa, it was very nice to help a guest relax. The lady at reception also painted my hand with henna, it was a beautiful touch. At the restaurant the service was very attentive, food was really delicious. They even had a live indian music band playing while we were there. Breakfast was really good. Good selection, but not too much where it's hard to decide.  Check out was a breeze. I'd stay here again for sure. Highly recommend

  The photos for this hotel look lovely, but I was terribly disappointed by the reality. The first room I was given did not have any windows - to their credit they moved me to a nicer room when I complained.   The surrounding area was blaring loud music both nights of my stay, all through the afternoon (when sitting by the sad and tired pool) and night (was still playing at 4am).   If you‚Äôre planning a trip to the Taj Mahal, I would stay one night in Agra at most, and not in this hotel. It‚Äôs sad and dated - the rooms are dark, towels are limp and greying, linen and pillows very thin.   The hotel car was very nice and they picked me up on time from Agra Cantt station, but it was highly overpriced (1000 rupees + tax) relative to other hotels I‚Äôve stayed at on my trip.

  Nice hotel, very empty which made it seem like we were the only guests rattling around.   Lovely room on ground floor with access to pool and gardens. Bed was comfy. Bathroom was very clean but the bedroom needed a good dust. Felt like no one had been in it for years. This is how the restaurant felt.   Breakfast was okay. We also tried lunch but because of the strange atmosphere and the dusty nature, it didnt fill us with confidence to eat there.   We were okay with the food we ate but chose to have dinner out.  The pool didnt look clean and the hotel needs a bit of a tidy up. The paperwork in out room was a bit knackered and it just seemed like the hotel thar time forgot.

  When its a question of ""Heritage Hotel"" in Agra, the answer is The Grand Imperial without doubt; however I feel there are more to be achieved to be called a ""perfect property in all respect"". Let me try to explain my statement. The location of the property is very good, everything like market and other famous land marks (Taj Mahal, Agra Fort) are all within 5 kms radious. Property is very well maintained. I must appreciate the way they are maintaining the heritage part of it. Rooms are huge and will certainty make you feel of that ""Royal Class"". I was delighted when they upgraded us in suite upon arrival, however delux rooms are also spacious I strongly believe. Almost all amenities like tea coffee machines, wifi, pool etc. were available in the property and with proper care.

  Jawaharlar Nehru slept here, as well as the Shah of Iran - however that was in the fifties, and since then, the hotel has slowly lost track with the modern times. This is quite charming in terms of room size and a terrific garden, and the bathrooms have been fitted with latest amenities recently. A nice and convenient place in a dirty, rotten city, reasonably priced, with a good restaurant, good breakfast and friendly staff. Easy to go to the Taj or the Fort within fifteen minutes by Tuktuk (80INR if you bargain reasonably). The suites are gigantic!  ¬†As in many of Indias hotels, be alerted with extras: A cup of tea is 140, the hotel car charges double price for long distance and four times of a regular taxi cab for short distance lifts.

In our opinion, the hotel staff should address this.  As one of my friends said, it is like a great old dame...however unfortunately the old dame has become senile with age.

Aircon in our room didn't work, the room was tired as was the bathroom that had black marks and stains on the ceiling. Outside, the pool was a problem with loose or broken fittings and nails sticking out from some of the broken wooden drainage covers.Most of the sun loungers were held togther with badly fixed bits of wood acting as legs and we even saw electric wires that were wrapped in tape very close to the waters edge. I'm sure in the past this has been a very good hotel but it had the feeling of neglect and decay when we were there which is a shame. The staff were mostly helpful and tried their hardest to make

In addition, he taught us stretches to reduce and manage the pain over the following days. We recommend Yogesh Kumar in Grand Imperial spa for anyone stopping here! (There's a nice pool next to the spa, too).

  My wife and I stayed for two nights at this hotel in order to visit the Taj Mahal. I wanted a room without wifi because RF radiation from phones had already caused me arrhythmia of the heart and episodes of severe depression.  Sunni the manager allowed me to use my acoustimeter to measure the signal in a number of rooms to find the one with the lowest; really patient and accommodating.  Then the chef Sanjee came to see me in the restaurant to organise dairy-free, gluten-free and organic meals.  He said that best would be to eat just Indian food which would satisfy all three requirements.  This I did and it was fantastic food too.  Full of flavour.  Sanjee created beautiful Indian dishes that were not even on the menu.  He was a delight. Sunni the manager said that he had seen

On arrival, there was an issue with one of the rooms we had booked but this was dealt with so sensitively and professionally that we were actually better off than with the original booking. When we arrived too late for breakfast after our sunrise trip to the Taj Mahal, the staff nevertheless welcomed us for breakfast without any fuss and without hurrying us. We quickly felt very much

The food in the restaurant was excellent and a good selection was offered for breakfast.   This hotel is on a very busy main road but as it has a large garden and perimeter walls it does offer a certain amount of sound proofing from the mayhem outside.   The location is good for visiting the Taj Mahal although recommend you arrange a car if visiting at dawn as not really advisable to walk there.  The negative points I feel need mentioning are that the drinks are quite expensive, around ¬£8 for a gin and tonic. Also, the puppet show in the front garden is only worth visiting if you have children. It is yet another opportunity for visitors to be fleeced out of yet more money

From jovial ""can do"" attitude, safe driving (somehow managing to negotiate the mayhem of Indian roads), restaurant suggestions (our request), and also hooking us up with another tuk tuk drive in Jaipur (again at our request) who was waiting with a printed sign with our name at the airport! The other fabulous find at the Heritage is lovely Sabiya, who handles the little jewellery cart out in the evenings at the Heritage

  We only had one night in this delightful hotel but we loved the comfort and uniqueness of our room.    The welcome we received was very warm, with a short tour of the grounds and up to the roof for a glimpse of the Taj.  Our room was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated.  The shower was good and bathroom well lit.  We enjoyed our evening meal and breakfast, served by attentive waiting staff.  An event was taking place in the garden in the evening which did delay our dropping off to sleep, but once asleep we remained undisturbed till morning.  I felt The Grand offered good value for money.

  This place is simply amazing. 110 years of history, and everything is as authentic as it can be. It really feels like going back to the last century, the ambience is wonderful, the staff is really attentive and helpful, the building is extremely well looked after, clean, and simply magic. The restaurant is wonderful and it offers outstanding food during the day and a rich and varied breakfast. The rooms are beautiful and original in their decoration. It really feels like time stopped here and there's certainly something magic in this place. We stayed two nights and we're glad we extended our stay, as this is not just a hotel to sleep and go, it's an experience in itself that would need at least two nights and some time in the garden and in the premises to be fully appreciated.

The restaurant and musicians was a great place to eat and chat at the end of an exhausting day and the spa was just the ticket.   Madhu and her staff were amazing nothing too much trouble...she really is a credit to this hotel.   The hidden gem is Sahaya on reception she remembered us from last time and went out of her way to get us the room we had previously on the ground floor backing onto the pool.   She makes everything seem so simple nothing too much trouble.   If we are lucky enough to return to Agra I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.   Thank you for an amazing

There was dancing event in the night we were there and it was nice. Staff were also friendly.   The puppet show was so funny. The 7 minutes of happiness. Totally recomended to see the puppet show. Restaurant is no no!! Best to avoid, as the food wasnt great, plates were dusty and I always had to wipe my plate first with napkin before putting food in it. Restaurant table cloth needs washing. It just felt so unwelcoming.   When we ordered a taxi service to delhi, the driver namely Imran, was not wearing seat belt all the way until reaching Delhi (there are cops in delhi that do fine the driver if he doesnt wear seatbelt)

A central  garden courtyard adds an air of serenity to the hotel and in the evening, a very sweet young lady, Sonya, paints henna decorations on your hands and arms, and two brothers put on a very entertaining puppet show. The bar is a trifle small, doesn't actually contain a bar, and is more a sitting area. Instead, the (rather limited) drinks are mixed in the kitchen and brought out to be served.

Our room 211 had a loose tile on the floor , the bathroom felt a refurb should have happened a decade ago (the shower worked , the bath tap didn‚Äôt).

Anyway I ended up in that room and was pleasantly surprised for what I had paid. Beautiful grounds and very old style colonial building. Room was very large and bed was comfortable. Opened up onto pool area. Being honest the rooms and pool could do with some attention. Need more attention to cleaning and pool really needs a deep clean and maintenance.

He was made to feel extremely uncomfortable and the Manager said somethng to him and from the look on our driver's face it wasn't pleasant. We asked him to translate but he refused, drank his drink and left.  I suspect he was told to drink it quickly and go!  We were then shown to our suite on the first floor.

  Staying in this hotel i s replete with royal and old world charm. Early morning tea in the garden while looking at squirrels and parrots which are regulars there was very calming. The pool with its chattri was again a very different experience. I would recommend staying in one of those suites with big baths. No complaints whatsoever. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. It's one of my favorites to go to anytime when i feel like a relaxing and rejuvenating vacation....

  We stayed in this hotel for one night only (happily) and our experience was extremely bad. First, when we arrived, we were told that they cannot give us our room because the A/C was u/s but they will arrange a better one in what they called the ""General Management Room"". They even made us think that it was a great opportunity for us because we will have two bedrooms. Then we had to wait for about 90 minutes to get the room. We were exhausted after a long journey, and I had to insist twice at the reception before they finally gave us the room. When we came in the room, we first thought it was a joke! See the pictures I published to realise... It was actually a poor staff room, not made for tourist at all. Dirty couches, mattress extremely harsh, smell of cigarettes... We decided

  The position of this hotel is really convenient for visiting the main tourist attractions - we paid about 100 Rupees (about USD 1.50) for tuktuks to the main attractions (Agra Fort and Taj Mahal). The hotel is a wonderful refuge from the hotel and noisy streets, and the pool is lovely, clean and well maintained.  We paid a small amount to upgrade from a deluxe room to a suite (also called ""Chamber of Prince"") and this spacious suite was wonderfully decorated and quite sound proof, with the added bonus of leading onto the pool area. We really loved the ""old feel"" of the place, yet it is still very well maintained and kept spotlessly clean. Finally, the staff were exceptionally good - kind and efficient, our every need was met with no trouble at all. A really welcoming place. Our

The rooms are beautifully decorated and the restaurant is more than adequate. The musicians in the restaurant were great. The WiFi could do with some work.  We forgot a wallet in the room when we left. The hotel contacted us, found out where we were staying the next night and by 8am the next morning we had the wallet back with everything in it.

  I stayed at Hotel Grand Imperial for one night with my family during my nine day long family trip to India. I had no clue of the hotel and booked it through Agoda as I got a good deal.  Upon arriving, we received warm welcome in traditional Indian way. The hotel is mesmerising with a history and heritage that dates back to early 1900s. The room amenities were up to the mark, parking was free, food at the dining was expensive but worth the money because of the live Rajasthani cultural music. The swimming pool is awesome and I should say the same about the lawn in front.  Had I known this hotel to be this good, I would have stayed a day longer than planned.   Btw, the great Tajmahal is quiet visible from the rooftop if you can get early in the morning.  5/5.

At least I want to give a BIG thank you to the girl at the reception (Sahaya), she helped me to get in contact with the hotel in Delhi, and talked to them, after I forgot my credit cards there. I am really thankful that I got all of them back, without problems!

The breakfast was the typically good Indian style, and there is an adequate dinner buffet for Rs700.   There was a lot of noise from the road and a pool party in the rear.   We had a couple of jarring moments; once when the hotel appeared not to have the right room for one of our party despite the booking being made months ago, and reception wanted to charge them for an upgrade (this was eventually sorted out). Secondly there was a weird moment when one of the hotel staff, expecting a tip, would not leave our room, and just stood there, staring at us. It was very uncomfortable. He then did the

  Agra is of course the home of the Taj Mahal which lived up to my high expectations but there really is no other reason to visit Agra.

We visited in January when the evenings are cold which I expected but was disappointed with the need to wear a fleece whilst eating dinner.

It was also very well sound proofed at the front which is a good thing as it is a very noisy area next to a main road. Fine inside the room, irritating in the nice gardens. There was also a wedding at the hotel on that night until early in the morning - check before you book if you value your sleep.

  This is a classical imperial building in the Raj style. However the rooms are in urgent need of improvement if the hotel is to retain its reputation and star rating.  The bathroom in particular needs improvement with very basic and exposed plumbing, a very dirty piece of material stapled across the window and a very basic shower with a dirty shower curtain.  The bed was very decorative, but was in fact two mattresses joined together. The bed cover was too small.  The sound proofing also needs to be improved - you get the sound of trains all night.

  It‚Äôs one of few - if not the only - historic hotel(s) in Agra. But it has seen more beautiful days in the last 110 years. We had a suite (107), which opened a door to the nice pool (btw: too cold to swim in January!). We loved the high ceiling and the famous ‚Äúhistoric bath tube‚Äù. Clean and functional. Just wait 2-5 minutes for the hot water (a sign showing that). Food was ok (we had a light dinner), but nothing special. We had to check out at 3:15 a.m. to reach our train. Asking for a night taxi the concierge offered us transportation by taxi (local travel agency) for 950 Rupies (tax included!). The railway station is about 2 km from the Hotel, for a ‚Äûall-day-Tour‚Äú in Agra we had been offered (outside the hotel) 1200 Rupies. The desk officer told us, there were no other

  The Grand Imperial is a lovely hotel. The rooms are stunning very well kept by the housekeepers. We stayed in room 203 after getting an upgrade and it was perfect. The hotel also offers free WiFi it can run out so you may need to get a new password from reception but they are always happy to help and it isn‚Äôt a problem getting a new password. The restaurant staff are very attentive and the breakfast was beautiful, lots of options. If you have a free afternoon with nothing planned we would sit in the gardens where they would come out and offer you food and drink. In an afternoon from 4 a lovely lady called Sabiya who would give out bangles and bindis, she also did fantastic henna tattoos for a very small charge.

  A tolerable hotel for one night, but certainly could use a serious makeover.  The good: - The decor is nice, reflects the region. I especially like the door locks. - Spacious grounds and what appeared to be a nice pool - Beer in the minibar  The not-so-good: - Overall, just out-of-date and dingy, particularly the bathroom - Despite the hotel not being full, we were given the room right next to reception, so it was noisy. For some unfathomable reason, the bathroom window is permanently open, so we heard (though didn't understand) all the employee conversations in the area just outside - Average food and average service in the restaurant, which itself was dark and dingy  I think this could be a truly great hotel with an update; as it is, not worth the cost in my opinion.

Although warmly welcomed on arrival, we found a lot of the staff to be pretty dismissive and unfriendly, in particular the sole female waitress on duty in the dining room in the evening and again at breakfast, she didn‚Äôt break a smile at all and was not very helpful; fortunately her male counterparts were friendly and helpful.  Likewise, I wondered down to reception in the early evening and was completely ignored, not as much as a Namaste, which was the only time we encountered this on our 11-day trip in Northern India.

One thing that you notice is the enthusiasm if the staff who always say a namaste when you meet them in the corridor.

This lovely heritage hotel that celebrates previous visits by presidents and princes provides spotless, comfortable rooms that look onto the lovely gardens. The kind, welcoming manner of all staff helped us relax prior to the excitement of visiting Agra Fort and, of course, the Taj Mahal.  The large bathroom appeared to be under maintenance and probably retained most of the original fittings which involved using a wooden box to step over the high sided bath in order to shower. This required challenging, high-risk manoeuvres getting out of the bath onto a wet, tiled floor. Water flow from the shower also needed attention.

  I usually don't like to give bad reviews to hotels - I can always find silver linings in places I stay at.  But I honestly cannot recommend this hotel. The buildings have charm but are decrepit and not well taken care of. The room itself is ok - large and comfortable bed - although quite dark as the window faces the hallway - but the bathroom is old and could do with some refreshing. There is a strong sewage smell by the pool. Worst of all though is the service: the front desk is all but helpful in making travel arrangements (actually it was even a bit difficult to communicate in English), the rest of the staff doesn't really go out of its way to help you out...  A shame since the Grand Imperial has the potential to be a great property.

  I loved staying here and the old fashioned feel to it! Would stay here again. The room was nice, comfortable, clean and spacious. I loved the view of the courtyard from outside my room and the pool was so pretty. I was a solo traveler and felt extremely safe here as the door is so secure there's even two rows of doors.  The water from the shower smelt of metallic/rust smell but after running it for about 5 minutes it disappears. Besides that can't fault anything and will be back next time I'm in agra!

  What a fabulous old building with a wonderful feel, our room was gorgeous as was the bathroom, all the staff were very pleasant and we had a lovely welcome. It was very hot during our stay and we were extremely disappointed that the hotel pool was closed for maintenance., it was one of the reasons for choosing the hotel.  It was lovely sitting on the grass having a drink in the evening before dinner.  The food was good but not outstanding.  I would certainly recommend this hotel and if we were to go back to Agra again would certainly stay here.

  The hotel is very good. The best is the aesthetic and the staff. Extremely nice and helpful people. The rooms are quite big and nice with truly vintage furniture. The only thing that needs to be fixed is the bathroom fittings; the hot water works perfectly, but the union between the showerhead and the tube was messy and a lot of water was dropped out of the shower. Nice restaurant with nice food and extremely nice garden to sit and chill with some drinks. However, I think it is a bit expensive compared with other hotels in the area.

  We decided to spend the long weekend of Independence Day in Agra. It turned out to be one of the most relaxing holiday we have ever had, that too in a 100 year old property built in the British era.   It is indeed a beautiful place to stay and our suite was so huge, beautifully done with the original four poster bed, lovely murals, the bath tub and washbasin of yesteryear. We did not want to move out of our suite, it was pleasant and impressive.We kept imagining all the royals who had stayed in our suite in the past and it was real fun. We saw all the signatures of the important people who had stayed at the property.  The big lawn was nice to relax and the puppet show was there too. Food was ok, not that great, need some improvement in that area. The pool was real nice and we

The decor and furniture were very tastefully done providing a wonderful setting. This heritage hotel has a well-maintained courtyard, staff was friendly and helpful. In the evening, they had a small flea market and live traditional music which was soothing. We wish we have stayed longer to appreciate the amenities.  We could easily get a Tuk Tuk just outside the gate, to visit the markets, Taj Mahal, and other interesting sites. We didn't ask if they have a tour package that includes tour guide. If we come to Agra again, we would explore with a Tour guide.

We liked the buffet style dinner with a live Rajasthani Musical performance. Breakfast was adequate. We swam, lounged about, and sampled their poolside bar and food service in the pool area....which was accessed directly by our suite's lounge area :)  The Grand Imperial is also close to the Taj and the Agra fort, making it an ideal night over at Agra.

The bathroom was a huge room with a very old bath and odd touches but it was quite fitting and very comfortable...getting you used to the assault on the senses that wonderful India is.

The resident squirrels were a highlight.  The food was awesome and staff very accommodating. We got all this plus an old heritage building charm for a bargain price!

  Five out of the six hotels in India and Sri Lanka chosen by Trailfinders UK for our private tour were of excellent top-quality, but unfortunately the Grand Imperial in Agra was a terrible disappointment not worth and far below the advertised standard. It may have a splendid history, but paying customers expect a bit more than that today. Bedrooms and bathrooms are dated and in desperate need of being refurbished. A sign in the bathroom requests you to wait 2 min. for hot water; both in the evening and the following morning we waited 20 min. but not a drop of hot water appeared. Very poor service: we booked and prepaid a triple room.

  Stayed here for 1 night to see Taj Mahal. Very historic and old property. Food great and service was great. This is a unique experience that not a lot of hotels in the area can offer. The room is simple and clean. If you are looking for modern accommodations, this place may not be for you. Shower pressure is low and all fixtures are old, but they I think that is what makes this place special...you feel like you're in India, not some some Western all-inclusive resort.

  The staying in hotel Grand Imperial Heritage was very pleasant and enjoyable for us. Me, my friend and our kids enjoyed the hotel stay. The most beautiful thing about the hotel is it's Heritage building and the Royal look. Rooms are very spacious and comfortable with traditional and the  royal look. Food was very good.  We liked the location very much, it's very near to Taj and Red Fort. Very friendly and polite staff at the hotel. Hotel has nice swimming pool, spa, and many more facilities.

  First time for me in India and by the time we arrived here, we had already stayed in the Oberoi in Bangalore and the Great Eastern in Calcutta, so reasonable to say we had already had a fair share of comparisons. The Grand Imperial was an ""Oasis"" beautifully maintained, friendly and attentive staff and for me a wonderful hotel all round. we could easily have spent longer here had it not been for our schedule. If you are looking for somewhere to stay close to Agra, and want colonial styled ambiance, comfort, and a place to shut yourself away from the cacophony outside then check this place out, I highly recommend it.

Bathroom really below standards with used water running almost directly in the bathroom itself...Avoid the massage, unfriendly and not worth it.

The food served in the restaurant was also fine, with a varied menu.   We saw a good deal of maintenance work going on there. With the area around the pool being painted, cleaning of the corridors going on and the garden being maintained. The pool is also nice and well looked after.   However, there is a point at which ""heritage"" becomes tired and shabby and colonial charm is not created by dark wood knick knackery. We had a room on the ground floor and couple of doors along from the reception. It was decidedly pokey, with little natural light. The

  The building took one back to the days of the Raj and the grounds and pool were very pleasant.  We did have a large room and bathroom, but it felt very outdated and the bathroom in particular is in serious need of an upgrade.  The overall impression of shabbiness was not helped by grey and worn towels.  This would have been an easy change to make.  We did enjoy our meal in the restaurant and the entertainment provided by the sitar musician. We were only there for one night and although the hotel was one of the cheaper places we stayed in on our trip to India I didn't really feel it represented particularly good value for money.

  Hotel is only saved by its staff and its old fashioned charm.  I wouldn't want to be there for more than one night.  The plumbing and electrics are decades old but it sort of doesn't matter.  The dining room seems to have no natural light at all and somehow it's easy to forget about that too.  The hotel is over priced for what it is but the service was exceptional.  Highlight was the Taj of course but the hotel organised tuk tuk rides through Agra with fabulous driver Jonny for sunset and sunrise are also up there in our India tour memories.

  The moment you step inside these beautiful grounds it takes you back to a bygone time of imperialistic splendour.   The rooms are spacious and clean although the bathrooms are in need of a remodel/tile update. The antique furniture and light fixtures are a treat. The grand staircases, beautiful gardens and pool make for a regal feel.  The restaurant is quite good. The restaurant service cannot be faulted and will render all your future service experiences inadequate. Santosh is especially attentive and personable. The onsite spa is a lovely respite from the chaotic city. Reception is not particularly helpful but they are pleasant.   We would definitely return should the opportunity arise and highly recommend to other travellers.

I did have a special birthday here and I was on my own so it was a pleasant surprise to be upgraded to a suite and have a surprise when I had dinner in the restaurant.  The buffet dinner was very good and the dosa cooked fresh for breakfast was delicious.  The hotel very kindly arranged a car to take me to Jaipur, which was expensive and I asked to stop at Fatehpur Sikri on the way, which bumped the price up by INR1000 but I didn't have much choice.

  The hotel is set quietly within its own grounds off a main road. The grounds to the front, and the pool area to the rear are well maintained and provide a haven from the bustle of the city. We prefer older-style hotels, and this delivered, although the decor was slightly jaded and needed some updating. yet on the whole, this did not detract from our stay. What did irritate, however, was the overt manner in which everything had a cost, and the hotel was quick to ensure that payment was made at each available opportunity. On checking in we were asked to pay for the accommodation straight away, rather than when checking out. No invoice was provided for this, simply a credit card receipt. The cost of transport was excessive: due to its location, and gated entrance, it was difficult

And they had the most helpful staff and a wonderful desk lady Ms.Sahaya who assisted us from checking in to the check out the next morning. While it's a good place to rest , this age old property may not be liked by fun seekers and the young. Just one piece of advice , the management should think of replacing the old colour TVs with the latest LCDs and LEDs available in the market.

There was a good flow of hot water from the shower though.  Food was average and the restaurant had little atmosphere and slow service. The traffic, trains and banging noises, loud talking, with possibly some maintenance  work going on disturbed our sleep, even wearing ear plugs.  We did comment on the damp bathroom when leaving but got no reaction.  Sadly this was the poorest hotel we staying in for our 2 week India holiday.

It was rush hour by then so it took over four hours to get to Agra...  2. We were offered upgraded poolside rooms which was a nice gesture but there was no water in the pool as it was having its annual clean with some very noxious smelling cleaning agents.  3. We pre-paid through Agoda for half board but we were told when we checked in that they didn't offer half board so we had to pay for meals.   4. We asked where the nearest bank

  I can't say too much about this hotel as we arrived quite late and checked out early the next morning.  However, what we saw of it was good.  The check-in procedure was quick and painless and there were plenty of helpful porters around to take our luggage to our rooms.  This is an OLD hotel and, to be honest, both our rooms were a bit musty, despite being very spacious and quite grandly appointed  For this reason I was going to give it a 3-star rating, but we asked to change one of the rooms and our request was carried out with so little fuss and bother by the reception staff that I upped my rating to 4-star.  Breakfast was the usual buffet-style selection of cereals, fruit, eggs-to-order and various Indian dishes that I can't remember the name of - plentiful and tasty.

  I need to say first up that I was sick when we stayed here so it probably coloured my opinion BUT the issues I had made being sick so much worse.   Anyone who has travelled in India will know that most hotel rooms have numerous light switches, with some apparently doing nothing.  You have to flick a lot of switches to turn lights off and on.  One switch that turned off our beside light also turned off the bathroom lights.  This meant I had to use my phone torch to go to the bathroom during the night - a lot!!  Annoying, distressing and unnecessary.  Then some of the staff who came to ""fix"" the problem didn't know about the switch.  It wasn't even the master switch - something you also learn about in Indian hotels.   Wifi also didn't work in our room.  It stopped about 10 steps

We love the quirkiness of Indian hotels and this one fitted the bill and it wasn't too bonkers!  Our large room was comfortably furnished with plenty of dark wood which suited the old fashioned charm of the hotel. The bathroom actually made us smile a lot!  This hotel won't be everyone's' cup of tea of course, but we loved it and if we ever re-visit Agra would stay there again.  The only issue we had was a wedding party in the courtyard. It was very loud. Although the music and other noise did stop sometime

  I REALLY wanted to like this place.  It's a lovely property, and the rooms were perfect.  They were filled with character, great bathrooms, comfy beds, spacious, and they provided a space heater, as it was January.  However, the comforts ended there, unfortunately.  Almost all of the rooms face an inner courtyard, and on the day of our stay, there was a wedding in that courtyard with absolutely thumping club music.  It started around 8pm (right around when my baby was trying to go to sleep) and the front desk said it would last until 11pm.  Considering many of the guests had to get up at DAWN for their tours of the Taj, i can't imagine i was the only one who took issue.  Finally the music stopped, at 11pm, but at about 1:30, i was awoken again becuase they chose that time to

  I put my foot down while selecting a hotel that the place must have a Lawn for me to play with my four yr old. I was darned against staying in BOX Hotels. And was I pleased with the place? More than I paid for I would say. Great Lawn, great corridors for my child to scoot around. The tall olden Brit rooms that are never too hot in summers and too cold in winters were a delight to sleep in. That the place was full of visitors comments starting right from the likes of Dr. Rajendra Prasad made the stay even more delightful. Smiling staff, Great Management, including the current GM, a wonderfully pleasant Lady who my family befriended.

On arrival I chanced asking for room upgrade, this was granted and we landed a suite. The hotel is very old and has a certain charm but an upgrade, electrical wiring particularly, is overdue. The suite was a good size and quite nicely furnished in a faded style, huge and comfortable bed, decent sized en suite though not all equipment (shower) was in prime working condition but all did work. Wi Fi as other reviewers noted was slightly hit and miss, took one of staff to get me logged on, but it worked reasonably if a bit slow at times. We only ate breakfast in the hotel, it was ok, reasonable choice, eggs cooked to order and fruit available. Small bar was

  I've never received such excellent hospitality! Very kind staff go out of their way to ensure your stay is comfortable. The rooms and the hotel itself are a whimsical look back 70 years. The food was also very good. The only minor complaints I have are for an upgrade to the Wi-Fi and that the mixed drinks were missing ingredients or just made entirely wrong. It didn't make much of a difference in my hotel experience though. Great location as well! I would absolutely recommend staying here.

  -Location wise it's near to the main attractions. Agra is not a very big city. Unless you're staying in some outskirt area, commute is not much of a hassle. -We're welcomed with smiles, garland and some complimentary drink. -Room is wonderful with the four poster bed, the wooden furniture. Bathroom is clean-ish. The towels provided were old and worn out. On insisting, we were provided with fresh and new towels. -Breakfast is the worst part of the hotel. The spread is very limited and the food tastes below average. I read a review on tripadvisor (a few months back) where in the hotel had replied that they would look into the measly breakfast but I guess, nothing has been done in this regard till now. At the price one pays (esp in peak season time) you'd expect something decent

Wi-Fi is not working well, very slow once I got on it.  We had NO noise from the street in our room, we slept very well.  Staff is very helpful and service has a general high quality.  It is a bit worn down so not comparable to a modern hotel (like radison etc) but you choose this for the heritage part.  Food is OK but nothing special (we had evening buffe and breakfast.

  After a long train journey from Goa expectations from this hotel were high and were duly met. Staff are professional courteous and more than helpful. Our room faced the garden but could benefit from a window for a view of the outside and some fresh flowing air as it can get a bit stuffy. We would have upgraded to a fabulous suite that overlooked the pool and gardens but as we only stayed two nights we would not fully benefit from the opulence but it's more than affordable. Restaurant is excellent with high levels of service at breakfast and dinner. Note all advertised prices exclude service and local taxes so what you see isn't what you pay.

The room was charming but the bathroom leaved a lot toe desired. Not the fact that it was old but that it had not been maintained. One thing that did aggravate was the constant selling experience. Puppets, jewellery,clothing. We were quite happy to purchase for the girls orphanage but once done we would have preferred to be left alone. The food, a buffet, was okay only. The dining room was lovely to look at with its chandeliers and there were many moments of a bygone fascinating era. There was a pool ( no time to try) and a spa which is best forgotten.

  Who would stay in modern glass and concrete hotels in Agra, when you could be in this turn of the century gem?   Sure it is not super smart, but it gives you a taste of how India was a century ago.  The smell, of which some complain, is simply the smell of an old buidling. The cooking is careful, and one eats beneath huge glass Belgian(?) chandeliers, in a room that has seen little change. Morning coffee on the roof, watching the monkeys scamper over the rooftops, and there, in the distance, smudged in smog, is the most beautiful dome Man ever made.  Stay in heritage to see Heritage.

  Our first room here was the dampest, worst smelling hotel room I have ever been in. I cannot believe they thought it was fit for people! We complained (actually the first time I've ever done that) and were upgraded to a much nicer suite on the quieter side of the building.  Even so, the room was stuffy and relatively unpleasant to be in. Apparently you can't open any windows because of roving monkeys (and we did see packs on the rooftops) which is adds to the stuffiness.  The food was sub-par. The staff were very nice and very helpful and because of that I feel quite bad leaving these review but it is honestly not a nice place to stay.

  Really impressed with this hotel on arrival, a beautiful old hotel with a history, gardens and a pool. However, there is a balance between a fine heritage hotel and one that is becoming a little too faded and reliant on historic charms and period furniture.  In particular, the bathroom floor became awash with water when showering and the stunning chandeliers in the dining room would merit a good clean to show them in their full glory.  The dining room lacked atmosphere and the food did not compare to that served in other hotels visited on our tour.  I loved staying here for one night but would have been frustrated by really minor niggles if staying for several nights.

  We were given a room that had a musty odour that compromised our sleep. The air conditioning did not have a remote for setting the temperature and the fan just recirculated the warm, musty air.

The location and grounds are beautiful and the breakfast was good. The other issue that affected our stay was the currency crisis which we learned about when we got up.

Our only issues were after coming back from a long day of sightseeing, all we wanted to do was sit on the lawn and have a few beverages, undisturbed, but there was a lady peddling jewellery who wouldn't leave us alone and the man running the puppet show put serious pressure on us to watch, when we really weren't feeling it, meaning we felt a bit of pressure and were uncomfortable for an

The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and could not do enough for you. Breakfast buffet was great with lots of choice, we particularly liked the dhosa's. We had the dinner buffet too which we preferred to the al a crate menu. Make sure you see the puppet show on the lawn each evening, very entertaining. Outside the hotel there is a tuk tuk driver, Johnny Vegas who took us around and showed us the sights and also arranged our airport transfer, very reasonable and absolutely trustworthy.

  You want a contemporary lavish hotel, this is not the place. You want to feel like a king or a touch of old times how they used to live, this is the place. Set your mind to let go of  things like an old lift, the dining hall is kinda old timer ..etc, you shall enjoy it. Food was more to curtail to the taste of foreigners, the desis find it hard to like it.  The place has good deals price wise, I would say grab a deal and be a king, queen for few days. I got a 14k room for mere 3000 Rs a night.

  The Grand Imperial Hotel Agra is just that, grand and imperial. It's located in a one hundred year old colonial purpose built building and still has the original bathrooms and plumbing. When I first turned on the hot water I got that faint rust smell that can only come from iron pipework, it took me back to my parents 1930's home I lived in as a child in the the 60's. The electrics are original and quirky looking like something from 40's England but again added to the charm and character.  The reception staff are very good but I did feel a little rushed.  We were given a flower garland and complimentary drink on arrival and did feel at home with the friendly and welcoming staff.

The highlight for us was the live concert which happens every night at the dining room. The classic musicians Arvind and Raj are excellent at what they do.

  This is the place to stay for people who do prefer heritage to generic modern and who want to relax. Rooms are nice and spacious (the standard rooms don't have windows that open and are very dark) and very clean. The pool (area) is nice (though very noisy from the ventilation system opening up to the poolside), breakfast very good (so is dinner). Staff is eager to please and very friendly (to the point of over-ambitious). The big downside is that there is no real coffee which should not happen at a place of this standard and price. Everything looks exactly like in the pictures. Location is good with a small fruit market around the corner. A tuktuk to the Red Fort/Taj/Cantt takes 5-10 min. and is about 50Rps. When in Agra I would only stay here.

It is a quirky experience to stay in a room like this because it is like going back in time but I was glad it was only for one night. The bathroom was very basic and the shower had to be held when in use. The door way faces an outside terrace and I'm not sure how secure this is.

  We should have read the reviews before booking this place. They claim that the property is heritage however the reality is that this is a tired run down place begging for some renovation. The reception is dark and dingy and that set the trend of our stay at the the Grand Imperial. We were upgraded to 'suite' for our planned two night stay and the room was old and the beds creaky. The photos are obviously old so please do not go by it. We spend a night at the place and could not sleep as our neighbors decided to run around the corridors all through the night. The receptionist/staff were obviously helpless in this situation. The staff are in dire need for new uniforms and several of them walk around with holes in their clothes. the wifi is good however does not work in the rooms.

To cool down since I didn't have the AC on with the windows open, I ordered a soda water and some snacks.  The room service guy gave me the creeps wanting to take photos of me and selfies with him.  I wasn't at all comfortable being a single woman traveler.    It then started to rain and my entire room started to flood.  The crazy thing is that they served my room service as it continued to flood -- at that point there were 3 men in my room.

501,Nice hotel in budget! , June 2016,Mukesh_Moody,3.0,"<q class=""IRsGHoPm"">

  Hotel is nicely built with colonial style interiors. Rooms are very nice, spacious and comfortable. Bathrooms are quite neat and clean.  Food is good and tasty. Quite near to Taj Mahal.   Negative: 1. Saw a mice in the dinning hall.  2. Pool water is tooo salty and it burns your eyes.  3. Doesn't have activities for kids...they will get bored during the stay very quickly! Hotel should think about adding some kids entertainment stuff.. Puppet show,  folk dance etc.

  Colonial style hotel that is very clean with a good sized room. Food was good and not expensive, as was the beer! Service throughout the hotel as excellent and the facilities were more than I expected with a large swimming pool. If I am in the area again I would stay without hesitation

503,quite a nice hotel - but with rats !, April 2016,Marion J,4.0,"<q class=""IRsGHoPm"">

  The staff was friendly, the rooms big and comfortable, the food nice, but the dining room had a couple of rats running around and seemingly nobody from the staff cared enough to do something about it.  I felt being back in the Rat Temple....

504,front desk service not match with the grand heritage building, May 2016,lawc22,3.0,"<q class=""IRsGHoPm"">

  when we arrived, the our luggages is still outside and we need to get drag the luggage into the lobby ourselves but that's OK. i felt that i am not welcomed by the front desk service personnels. in addition, i knew the formality of check-in required documents.. i appreciate if they request all documents in one shot. smiley face would be good.  to be fair, having dinner in the restaurant is a bliss.. the services is awesome and very comforting experience. another plus point is the free wifi!.. all else, the grand heritage building is a gem itself. the lawn is immaculately maintained.
