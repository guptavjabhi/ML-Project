  After experiencing my stay at amar villas I can tell you this property will be my reason to revisit the Great Taj mahal. Since I was not aware about the history of the property so on my arrival at the property I assumed that this would have been a very luxurious palace converted to a hotel. The true detailing and experience that actually mesmerizes all your 5 senses can't be captured in couple of pictures or in a review. You have to be there to feel it.  Pros 1. Lush green landscape with exotic flora and fauna 2. Fantastic architecture relevant to the region  3. Royal entrance unlike a modern hotel with a porch opening up in the lobby. Here there is a massive stone darvaza(gate) that opens up in a very big courtyard and garden with countless fountains  4. spacious rooms with
 </>
 < class=""_1M-1YYJt"">
  modern amenities and detailed interiors  5. All the rooms are taj facing and along with that the view of the hotel is nothing less than taj 6. Extra ordinarily warm and friendly staff. Special thanks to Mr pathak(gm), prache(room manager),shashank(restaurant manager), chef saurabh for ensuring that our experience was memorable 7. Dinner under the stars is a must to do at amar villas in my opinion(you will not regret it) 8. Excellent food and customising it is totally possible   Cons  There are ups and downs in all the property but what matters is that how well the hotel makes it up to you once you have informed them about it and these guys will leave no stones unturned.

  We visited Amarvillas Agra with our family in the month of January 2021. Coming from the hectic work schedule in Delhi, it was one of the best holidays for us. Starting from the moment we entered Amar villas until the day we left from the property each moment was an experience we shall never forget. The Hospitality was unmatched and each member of the staff personally took such good care of us and our kids that it felt like we are their family and it’s our home. Mr Vishal Pathak, the GM, was kind enough to take out time to meet us and take our feedback many times during our stay. Mr Deep, Mr Harshid , Mr Akash and each person we came in contact with, touched our heart. It was an experience beyond our expectations. They did not leave anything undone whether it was the surprise

  Fantastic view and proximity to Taj Mahal. Ideal place to stay in Agra if you want to enjoy a luxurious and relaxing vacation. The property is awesome with 10 mins walk to TAJ. You can have wonderful views from almost every room. The added advantage is the lovely food and warm hospitality of the staff.  We enjoyed the candle lit dinner with taj views to celebrate our 20th anniversary. A perfect place to do so.

  The exteriors of the Amarvilas are just stunning, an architectural feat almost, with perfectly manicured lawns, greenery, shrubs pruned to perfection and gorgeous landscaping! The way the local sandstone has been used to weave their outdoors is mindblowing.  The views the Taj from the room balconies is unbelievable! I mean where in the world can you get that, looking at te wonder of the world while sipping your tea/cofffee!  The staff and service is 10/10, and really cannot get more co-operative or courteous. I will have to say I travel a fair bit, and ave stayed at some top properties, but the service at Amarvilas surpasses any other absolutely. To give an example, breakfast is supposed to be upto 10.30am, but they served us in the room till 11-30-12pm! Without any hesitation

  The Oberoi Amarvilas was the most impressive place we stayed during our two weeks holiday in India. The location is stunning, our room was on the third floor with the large balcony which had a great view of the Taj Mahal. All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the staff who served us at Esphahan. The food served at Esphahan was great with high quality, we loved the old delhi butter chicken which we called it the “best butter chicken ever”. The attention to detail was superb. If you have the worry about a long day road trip, hard to find quality food outside of the hotel, meal boxes were provided in the breakfast restaurant for all the guests to take extra free food to eat on the road. It is a hotel that is loved by travelers, highly recommend the Oberoi Amarvilas

  Since my engagement, my husband (then fiance) wanted to make me stay at The Oberoi as each and every room has a view of the Taj (the symbol of eternal love). I saw the pictures and immediately agreed for Amar Vilas to be the start to our moons.  We were at the property for just 1 night - from 19th to 20th of Dec, 2020.   Our stay was nothing short of excellent. We were greeted at the entrance and from then on, we had people serving, helping, guiding us throughout our stay. The food was exceptional. Being a luxury property and having a lot of foreigners as their guests, we had assumed the food to be bland but it was just outstanding - breakfast, lunch as well as the dinner. The staff arranged a special balcony dinner for us as it was our honeymoon. There was a personal butler who

  This was our second trip to Amarvillas . First time we stayed at this property three yrs ago and it was just wow . But now this hotel should not be called 5 star . They are charging so much but was sorry to see it’s conditions detoriating. When you go to one of the top most hotels in the country you expect best of everything . Staff was courteous and helpful. But everything else was not good. Food was not at all tasty . Rooms were clean but wooden flooring was dirty .All working staff seemed to be young and no experienced person was there! Very less range of menu, poor presentation specially Curd which was sour, South Indian was really bad! On complaints , they offered to replace but of no use! Specially on getting packed sandwiches on checkout , it was a phenomenal charge ,

Also missing is a walking/jogging track.

They have perfected the art of hotels. The external views of this hotel are monumental, just like the other ""vilas"" hotels in Jaipur and Udaipur. This hotel has an added  bonus of being located only 600 metres from the gate of the Taj Mahal, the most famous building in the world. The added bonus of the presentation of a garland of fresh flowers to each guest on arrival, is a nice touch. Our bedroom faced the Taj Mahal and we could see it from our bed. That is an amazing view that everyone can have, just by staying at this hotel.

They were so helpful and thoughtful in creating an itinerary of memorable stays at each of the Oberoi properties at these locations.  Working directly with Oberoi gave us peace of mind that all details would be covered, and came with more amenities for less cost than working with a third party tour operator or web booking service.  We just booked the domestic flights directly with the airlines to complete the trip.  And at each location, we worked with Oberoi’s Concierge to plan our own personalized site seeing with wonderful guides and private drivers.  The guides were very knowledgeable and tailored our day to suit our interests

  Sitting on our balcony of the Oberoi sipping drinks watching the sunset over the Taj Mahal nothing could make it more perfect. When we entered the gates of the hotel from the busy hectic road that leads to the the Taj my jaw dropped and I felt a lump in my throat as the hotel is a monument in itself. We were met with smiles, a cold towel and a cold fruit juice. Room fabulous and service impeccable. Thanks to all the staff.

  Really more of a three star property. The grounds and exterior are lovely. The best part of this hotel is its location. You could walk up the street to the Taj Mahal entrance if you wanted to. If you face the poolside, you should have a view from your room of the Taj Mahal. The bar and terrace outside the bar have lovely views as well.  The staff tries, but they speak at such a low level it is hard to hear them.   The rooms are somewhat ordinary. The internet was spotty. Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it didn’t. It was out for a good portion of one day for some reason.The phone in our bathroom was barely attached to the wall. I reported it, but they never fixed it. The makeup mirror was not attached to the wall and did not have a light. The drawer with the hairdryer was

  Nothing frames the ethereal Taj Mahal better than this hotel with its stunning views towards the monument, overlooking its own splendid gardens. It is also always soothing to return to a Oberoi property done in the ""traditional"" style which makes it so unique ; in times when some of the hotels in the group undergo modernization and loose their previous charm. The team was very efficient and willing to go the ""extra mile"" - under the discreetly present and able leadership of GM Mr Vishal Pathak - to make our stay extraordinary and truly memorable. Close proximity to the Taj Mahal's east gate makes it very convenient to visit the monument at different times of the day and seeing it in various shades of lights is highly recommendable. In summary, a very glorious weekend!

  We’ve been to sixty nations and stayed in many hotels across the spectrum.  Oberoi in Agra is at the very top.  Sure, the room’s balcony view of the Taj Mahal with nothing but green in between is unbeatable.  What takes Oberoi Agra to the pinnacle is it’s staff.  Everyone — and I mean everyone — treats guests as though nothing could be more important.  The food is exceptional as well.  Very pricey but somehow worth every rupee!

  Oberoi, in our opinion, is the finest small hotel chain in the world..bar none. Ask a question..and staff will answer you by name..and say:  ""Let me take you there"". And they do. Drop-dead architecture, built by Oberoi, not repurposed. On check-in, we could clearly see the Taj, not 1/2 a mile away. Spectacular ! Excellent international restaurant..and breakfast (buffet or a la carte) and a second Indian restaurant with quiet sitar music at night.  Here's what you may not know: air pollution comes and goes and can be awful. The second morning we looked out our window at dawn, as recommended, to see the rose color on the Taj marble...but the smog totally obliterated the whole tomb.  Presto ! All gone !

The property is the place to stay in Agra being only 600 metres by buggy from the Taj Mahal and offering great views from balcony rooms. We thought the food at both the Indian and multi cuisine restaurants was the best of all the Oberois we stayed at during the trip. Menu choice was good and service well drilled. We had pizza and french onion soup one lunchtime which compares well with restaurants back home in Europe. The more formal Indian restaurant was very high quality.

The location is a very short ride from the Taj Mahal, which is arguably the most gorgeous structure in the world.  The breakfast service was poor here. There are lots of staff milling about looking busy, yet it took us 20 minutes each day to get coffee. I want my coffee before getting my breakfast! No excuse for that.

  It truly is a world class hotel with a world class view of the Taj Mahal. Keep in mind however that the road that takes you there begins with evidence of lives of extreme poverty, then passes into tourism related businesses, and then, there is this extremely palatial hotel. I love a great hotel. I appreciate that this glorious place is a significant local employer. But I have to wonder / is there no  connection with the town in which it resides? Is there no charitable element? This is something that I believe must be considered as you travel through this country, most particularly when you travel in luxury.

  The calm of this luxury resort is what hits you first along with the changed style of architecture after driving through Agra. This has to be the best place to stay in Agra with such magnificent views of the Taj Mahal - weather permitting - which it did not oblige on our visit with the morning mist persisting past our departure time! The hotel may have no control over weather but we found the restaurant a little soulless hence the marks granted! Great sense of grandeur and the location will ensure its popularity for years to come so it should not rest on its laurels!

  Dear Vishal My family and I want to thank you for the warm and gracious hospitality we experienced during our stay at the Oberoi Amarvilas.  On arrival, Prachi and your team greeted us with a special reception that made us immediately feel at home.  Special thanks to Deep and chef Avreet who organized for us a sumptuous meal near the swimming pool and where Avipsa and Vipin went out of their way to make us feel special.  While we did not meet our housekeeper, he/she were also very attentive to every detail in the suite. And we can’t say enough about your property and the commanding view it has of the Taj Mahal. The setting, the accommodations and the staff have really made our stay memorable, for that we will always be very appreciative and grateful.  Thank you for helping us

The Taj Mahal can be viewed from every guest room and from many of the common areas of the hotel. Our room was very nice. The concierge arranged for a great tour guide and driver who showed us around the Taj Mahal and Red Fort. They also took us to some very nice shops. Breakfast at the hotel was delicious! We enjoyed two dinners at Esphahan. Exceptional food and service. This is definitely the place to stay in Agra.

  The best hotel in Agra along with ITC Mughal - but it's proximity and views (every room faces the Taj Mahal) to Agra's crown jewel puts it in front, in my opinion.   The front desk team (from concierge to reception) and the food and beverage staff go out of their way for you, which is typical of the Oberoi chain of hotels. I feel lucky to have stayed here a couple of times. The only let down this trip was the spa (in that regard, ITC Mughal's spa reigns supreme). The team was surprisingly disorganized. However I believe we were just unlucky as last time I had no issues.

  As soon as you arrive at this hotel you get your first glimse of the Taj Mahal. Although our room was not particularly big we did have a balcony with views of the Taj. Unfortunately the main restaurant was closed for renovation when we were there so the room where we had dinner on two nights was not very atmospheric and the service was not as good as the other Oberoi hotels we have stayed in. There is a lounge/bar area for drinks and they have dancers each evening outside. Outside around the pool is a lovely area for snacks/lunch.

  The Oberoi Amarvilas is situated in a perfect location with views of the Taj Mahal (which unfortunately we didn’t get to see as it was too foggy but that’s not something under the hotels control). The property has wonderful gardens around the pool area and is nice and peaceful. Stayed for one night to enjoy time at the Taj Mahal and whilst the levels of service were outstanding as you’d expect at any Oberoi hotel the hotel is beginning to show its age with the rooms needing a bit of an update. Everything was spotlessly clean and the service, particularly in the restaurant was outstanding. Food was delicious and the chef was always around to talk to guests and ask for feedback. Definitely recommended for anyone wanting to stay right by the Taj Mahal!

  We are great Oberoi fans and during our travels to India over the past 10 years have always stayed in the Grabd in Kolkata and the Oberoi in New Delhi.  We decided on this trip that we would treat ourselves to one night at the Amarvilas to see the Taj Mahal.  I had visited the Taj before but the rest of the family hadn't and so it was incredible to be able to stay and see the Taj from our very comfortable room and the bar area.  The service from all of the staff is amazing - Ripudaman in the restaurant was excellent and deserves a special shout out he certainly made sure that we were extremely well fed! I would return tomorrow if I could.

  You cone to Agra for two reasons. To see the Taj Mahal, and then to see it again! (Plus the fort is pretty spectacular). So why wouldn’t you stay in a hotel that has a view of the Taj? You certainly don’t want a room facing out the back of the hotel!!  At this time of year (December) it can be quite foggy in the morning but to see the Taj emerge in its white resplendent beauty is quite a thing!! The hotel lays on golf carts to take you to the Taj which is a fun way to arrive.  As to the hotel, it is very good. If your tour of India involves staying in some of the amazing palaces (see my other reviews), then this will feel a bit Best Western to their Four Seasons. It is of course a very good, modern hotel with excellent facilities and dining options. The breakfast is superb and

The main entry courtyard and fountains were quite enchanting, and as the doors open to a resplendent lobby, one cannot help but be drawn further in to gaze out the grand windows as the domes of the magnificent Taj Mahal itself come clearly into view.

The staff is lovely, the pool area is the most beautiful I've ever seen, and the privacy of the hotel itself is fabulous. If you want to stay at a luxury hotel and visit the Taj Mahal, this is the way to do it. The property is a very short golf cart drive away from the hotel, and the hotel staff will take you. The golf carts from the Oberoi can park closer to the Taj than any other hotel, so this really makes things easy as pie. Would love to visit again.

  The wow factor is certainly there. From the moment you arrive you are caught up by the resplendent landscaped gardens with the Taj Mahal in the distance. A more romantic location is hard pressed to find. Yet there are some less than polished elements in the restaurant waiters.

  Stay here! The views are simply magical, service amazing and the hotel and grounds are beautiful.  Had fabulous tea in the lobby overlooking the Taj.  Then a delicious evening dinner on our balcony (reserve a 3rd floor room if you are able to for a balcony but all rooms have Taj views I believe).  The rooms are very elegantly appointed.   The experience of watching the sun rise the Taj is one of my favorite travel experiences ever and absolutely my favorite experience in India.    It’s a quick walk (or the hotel will drive you in a golf cart), for a tour of the Taj.  Afterward take an afternoon dip in the stunning pool to revive.  It’s all highly recommended.   Save up and make this hotel part of your Taj experience - it is worth every penny...or rather worth every Rupee.

My husband had to contact the hotel three times to get a response.  He simply wanted to make a reservation for the ""dining under the stars"" experience.  Response only came when he contacted the GM. 3) Breakfast buffet is light in terms of options and variety compared to other 5-star hotels.

  This is a superb hotel, with exemplary service.  The level of service at this hotel redefines the word. In fact, if I'm being honest its all a bit OTT and becomes tiring after a bit because you are never left alone to relax. You are always being asked if you need something from the large army of staff. The hotel is very attractive and the view from the hotel of the Taj Mahal was better and more impressive than actually visiting it in person.   Downsides? Well, the levels of smog and pollution are appalling. The air quality is so bad, it gives you a permanent sore throat and headache when you step outside.

The buffet breakfast was very good and various dishes are made to order - try the dosa for breakfast - it looks huge (like a rolled up newspaper) but it is thin so is not as filling as it looks - it comes with various relishes you dunk the dosa in.

  What a fantastic hotel the is! The greeting was lovely - the staff were so friendly. The room, which had a balcony looking towards the Taj Mahal, was very well appointed and very comfortable. The meals were delicious and beautifully presented. Nothing was too much for the staff and we only wish that we could have stayed for longer. Perhaps next time...? The staff should be congratulated for making our brief stay so enjoyable, thanks.

  The location of this hotel is obviously outstanding for the Taj Mahal and so nice that all rooms have a view. This was our first experience out of three Oberoi hotels in India. From getting out of the car, we were made to feel very welcome, with a drink and the first views of the Taj. Breakfast was outstanding, so much choice from the buffet and further menu. Service a little show from the seating round the pool but not a problem if you have the time to wait... The only slight downside was when we ate in the restaurant, we were in what felt like a little lobby outside the main room so there wasn't much atmosphere. We were too busy on trips to use the pool or spa unfortunately, but did take a stroll round.

  Location, location, location — the Oberoi sits in a perfect location overlooking the Taj Mahal on a beautiful piece of property.  We spent 2 wonderful nights.  Every room shares the Taj view as the rooms are all on one side of the hotel.  Obviously, the view gets better the higher you are in the hotel.  Each room also looks down on the pool and lawn area which enhances the view.  The rooms are large and have a nice balcony with a table and chairs.  Very quiet and comfortable.  Lots of staff to greet you and help with any concerns.  I would have given it a 5 star review, but we found the hotel to be a little inflexible on dining.  We decided to pare back on our eating one evening because we had been eating so much great Indian food, so we decided to get some wine and “snack”

  This hotel is stunning, having now stayed at 4 Oberoi properties across India, it is clear that they use local influences in the design of their hotel and as this one sits facing the Taj Mahal, the architectural cues are clear.   The pool area is beautiful and every room has a view of the Taj, which looks beautifully majestic sitting just in the background.   As with all Oberoi properties, the food and service is excellent, if a little slow on occasion.   The property is about 600m from the entrance to the Taj, so you are well located for the main event!!

We arrived at sunrise - around 6 am from memory - and there were very few people at the Taj Mahal.  It was perfect. It's a lovely hotel in a perfect location, with superb staff.

  I called in a drink in the bar and for lunch but sadly the restaurant facing Taj Mahal is closed for lunch and renovation work means it’s not as tranquil as it should be.  It was an incredibly hot day I ordered two starters: cold soup followed by roasted broccoli. They brought my broccoli dish when I was barely half way through my soup. I asked them to bring it later and when it arrived, it was over cooked and soggy. For the price I paid I expected a lot more than that. I was also repeatedly asked to show my ID first in the lobby and again in the restaurant. They even took my ID away and took a photocopy. What's this obsession all about?

We were then shown our room which had a very large window for further views. The room was luxurious and staff were keen to ensure we were happy and had everything we needed.

  This Oberoi is the only place to stay when visiting the Taj Mahal. The view is unparalleled, the pool garden is magical. Reminds one of the step wells.  The chef is excellent and food comparable to other Oberoi.   The dinning room however was not comfortable or welcoming, if felt temporary, an inside room with no view and a bit out of date visually. Felt more geared to conferences.  The pool terrace could have been a lovely spot for breakfast or dinner but the opportunity seemed to be missed.  The major difference I suspect here is guests stay such a short time, one night, maybe two, so the staff seems not accustomed to building a rep-ore with guests.

  Upon arrival at the hotel, you get amazex by the view of the Taj. To be honest pictures do not make justice to the view, as the landmark is seen much smaller in the pictures (due to the way most cameras are set in order to get a wide angle view)   As it is common in the Oberoi, the quality of the staff is outstanding. Much better than what you can get used to when luxury travel. Staff goes completely out of the way to make your stay 100% satisfactory. This is why they have such a high CSAT (customer satisfaction rating).  All rooms have a view of the Taj, here  i would really recommend a room with a Balcony, there is not such an experience as to have a cup of tea in the balcony looking at the Taj such closely woth the peace of your room.

The hotel also arranged tickets to the Taj Mahal and golf carts to take us there and back at no extra cost, while the snacks and tea/coffee served in the lobby bar for those of us who were keen to visit the monument at sunrise was a nice gesture on their part. The service levels from the staff exceeded all our expectations as they went out of their way to ensure we had a memorable stay

Amazing hideaways around the grounds all wrapped with ‘King &amp; Queen’ like service standards from such brilliantly aware staff. This is a hotel to loose yourself in.

Though the Taj isn't lit, seeing its silhouette by moonlight was special. Our first night, we splurged on dinner served on our balcony, which was actually quite reasonably priced given the amount of food and the location. If you choose this option, prepare for a three hour, five course marathon of a thali, but it was a phenomenal introduction to Indian food, using a variety of vegetables in season (May) and grown locally.

Everyone works so hard to give you the best possible experience. And then there is the cuisine where they catered so beautifully to our western options. Our second visit and well worth the return.

  I've stayed in luxury 5 star hotels all over the world and I can confidently say that the Oberoi Amarvilas is the BEST! I've honestly never experienced such incredible service. From the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty! Actually, it began even before we arrived. Through emails we were communicating about our desire for vegan food and for private transportation, etc. The staff handled every request for us. The chef came out to greet us at every meal to make sure we were happy with the food! Even while eating by the pool a chef came out to make sure everything was to our liking. During our last evening we were invited into the kitchen to witness the magic and was even presented with a gift. The service was incredible. They sent a private driver to pick us up in New

We were visiting in the off-season in !ay which I would recommend because of the few fellow tourists at the time with only 20 of the 100 rooms being occupied. All rooms have a view of the must-see Taj. The balcony was large, room was standard, not overly large but spacious and well-appointed with modern bathroom and two very comfy king-sized beds. The service  and staff at the hotel from the personal greeting delivered by the manager right down to the pool attendant was excellent with the friendliness and genuine concern for the guest a stand-out.  We spent a lot of time at the beautiful and large pool with areas to escape the sun if need be. It is a great design and one of the better

  My mum and I stayed here as the first night of our first ever visit to India. If you want to stay at the Oberoi Amarvilas in Agra it's worth booking well in advance. It has the wow factor as soon as you arrive in the first courtyard. Once you enter the opulent reception area your eyes are drawn up to a wonderful golden dome with an enormous beautiful chandelier hanging over stunning flower arrangement. This flower arrangement was changed overnight to another colour scheme of flowers. You then look ahead and realise you can see The Taj Mahal. Wow... even from a distance you can see it's beauty. Staff were beautifully dressed, the attention to detail was exquisite everywhere you looked. We were given a garland of bright marigolds around our necks. When we entered our room there

We enjoyed lazing by the pool in the afternoon and generally relaxing. The food was great and the service of a high standard.

Their properties are beautiful, in character with the areas, their rooms/suites are classy, comfortable and the staff go so far out of their way to ensure an amazing stay.   It is impossible to find staff anywhere in the world that come close to the personal, caring and simple gestures performed by Oberoi staff.    You come back to your room to find little Velcro tags holding your computer cords, airphones etc neatly, little kit to clean computer/telephone screens etc etc etc.  Unbelievable the thoughtful

  Another great Oberoi hotel, this time in Agra. Every room has a full view of the Taj Mahal. They give you a small breakfast at 6am and then you go in a golf cart with a guide to see the Taj Mahal at sunrise before returning for your real breakfast. The swimming pool is the most beautiful I have ever seen. The only negative is that the pretty umbrellas around the pool do not move and it is almost impossible to find a spot out of the sun.  This is dangerous and not appropriate. Oberoi - please fix!!

  As you drive up to the security gate the amazing architecture of this hotel quickly reminds you that you are clearly in India to visit the Taj. Once inside the first thing you see at the rear of the lobby is a large window that frames a direct view of the Taj Mahal. It almost looks like a picture but trust me it’s the real deal. After receiving a fresh cold towel and a cool beverage at check in we arrived in our 5th floor room overlooking the Taj. Just know that every room can see the Taj in all its glory but lower floors have a partially blocked view. The trade off for booking a first floor room is you also get a private balcony with a table and chairs. Because the Oberon is very close to the Taj, the hotel offers a complimentary golf cart and driver to take guests to and from

  After a long travel day across dusty India, wouldn't you like to relax with a cold Kingfisher on your balcony overlooking the Taj Mahal? Well, check in here. All rooms look out with unobstructed views of the famous Taj not a half mile away. The rooms are large, well-appointed. The bathroom was spacious with the latest plumbing advances. The Oberoi standards are well-kept in Agra. Esphahan, the Indian restaurant was excellent (butter chicken, please). The second night, we dined in the main dining room, which is also the breakfast room and the atmosphere is the less for it. But the meal and service were stupendous.

  Well it’s got to be by far the finest hotel we have every stayed with service to match. The gardens and pool are immaculate, staff super attentive. And with a room looking across to the Taj Mahal what more could you wish for? Advice, try to get your Taj tickets on line by E ticket saves loads of hassle. Get a good guide, we used Asif Ali a local man on: +91 98373 46513 he has studied Indian history in depth and was a Joy to be with. Enjoy the Taj Mahal is breath taking.

  The Oberoi Amarvilas is arguably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. Our suite B. K. Nehru (512) was a dream, large spacious and beautifully appointed, every room within the suite had a wonderful view of the Taj Mahal and with a spacious veranda. The grounds and pool area are magnificent. Staff are very friendly and keen to please. Its location is excellent for visits to the Taj Mahal, with electric carts to take you up to the entrance area. We wish we had stayed longer and feel there was so much more to be enjoyed there, which we didn’t even manage to see, let alone experience. It is a truly wonderful place to stay.

  It was my dream to visit the Taj Mahal for my 50th birthday. I would never have booked this hotel but my friend is extravagant, and I am very glad of that. We were advised we only needed one night here, but if you can stretch to more, then my advice is that it is money well spent. We were sad to leave after 3 nights of luxury and indulgence.  From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated like royalty.  The staff is, without exception, extraordinary. My birthday was celebrated as much by them as it was by me, and I was overwhelmed by their kindness. Special mention for Deepak, Shripal and Marc.  When we arrived, I cried.

There will sometimes be issues that arise during a stay, in spite of best efforts, but the key is how the hotel responds to them.

Facilities are also good, with an excellent pool and 2 restaurants on site.   An excellent stay, the only reason for giving it 4 stars not 5 was that the decor is a bit dated and worn around the edges (not refreshed) for 10 or 15 years I think, but it was definitely not of bad quality still very good other than the old furnishings our stay was perfect.

  After seeing the wonders of the Taj Mahal, you need somewhere to rest your feet, a place of peace and elegance to contemplate the beauty of the experience...and drink a cold beer before tackling the hunger you have worked up.  You can see the Taj from the upper floors of the Oberoi hotel - and you can see the Oberoi from the Taj.  They're right on each others' doorsteps.   The Oberoi, in its own way, is also a place of peace and beauty and a drink on its lovely terrace needn't break the bank. The restaurant offers a buffet which is quite expensive if you aren't absolutely starving, but the set menu more than satisfied our appetites for less than £50 for two.  If that seems a lot, consider how little it is in percentage terms compared to the overall cost of visiting the Taj

Book your tour through the hotel.  You get a golf cart ride to the Taj Mahal and the guide helps keep the street vendors away if you want them away.

Sadly as a disabled guest the stairs were a nuisance so I was escorted via another doorway going in and out to avoid them. Bedroom was stunning although there is little actual storage space and with three suitcases we found all we could do was just keep these open in various locations to get to our things.very comfortable bed but the bathroom had poor lighting and minimal shelf space. Plenty of lotions and potions and on our last night they filled the tub with rose petals which gave a lovely fragrance in the room.

The staff is among the best that I have experienced; they are genuinely friendly and helpful.  You can't just teach the staff to interact with the clients in this way; it also has to be part of their nature.  Exceptional.

Every one of its bedrooms faces the Taj Mahal.  The view is fantastic and takes your breath away.  Prepare to be wowed.  The grounds are lovely.  The staff are fantastic - very personable and great service.  The Taj is a spiritual experience and this hotel extends that experience throughout your stay.  Golf buggies can be used to get to the Taj as motorised vehicles are not allowed at the Taj.

  I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It is spectacular.  Every room has a view of the Taj so I won't even bother posting another photo. The rooms are gorgeous and totally comfortable. Service is impeccable.  The restaurants are great. In particular, have a thali at the Indian restaurant. It is delicious and reasonably priced. You can easily walk to the Taj or take a golf cart.  And if you like to look at buildings, you really should get there before you die.  The rates are really high but it is hard to duplicate the experience.

  What could be more beautiful than looking out of one’s bedroom balcony to the vision of the Taj Mahal? When you stay at the Oberoi Amarvillas in Agra, every room has an unobstructed view to the temple built for love. We were met with garlands of marigolds, ginger tea, and a red dot on our foreheads as a sign of welcome. Resembling a palace, the grounds are spectacular with pools, waterfalls, and pavilions while the bedrooms boast an elegant and comfortable classic Raj décor. Having a balcony was an added bonus to overlook the pool and watch the dancers who perform nightly on the wall. This hotel is within walking distance of the Taj Mahal, which is best seen twice—at sunset and sunrise. The service is impeccable and we especially appreciated the attention of Marc who took

  We had 2 nights in the Lord Curzon Suite and the whole experience was first class. A very short walk to the Taj Mahal (complimentary golf buggy if you want it) and all rooms face the wonderful site. Hospitality in every department is excellent and the food too. The gastro Indian restaurant is wonderful as is breakfast.  The Oberoi is in an entirely different league to any other hotel in Agra. Without naming names, we paid a visit to the supposed second best hotel in Agra and it is quit simply worlds apart.   Oberoi is pricy but worth it.

  On this, our very first trip to India, we naturally sought to visit the Taj Mahal in Agra, and the Oberoi Amarvilas Hotel is, without a doubt, one of the vert best hotels in the world to highlight such a memorable visit. This is an exceptional boutique hotel with only 102 rooms, all of which have a view of the Taj Mahal, and in proximity to the East Gate entrance, where complimentary transportation via a golf cart is provided. Our room 111 is one of the very nicest with a private terrace and patio with direct views of the Taj. This is an exquisite hotel in terms of its beauty and amenities.

  This hotel is beautiful and the view from the rooms is simply spectacular. But what really impressed us was an encounter with a young lady who is attending the Oberoi school of management. She is in the culinary class, and hearing her describe her journey made us true believers in the special spirit that Oberoi creates for its guests. This young lady came to our table to introduce herself and ask if we were intrestws in a kitchen tour. We were too tired that first night, but when we had dinner the second night she found us and offered the tour again.  The following morning at breakfast she stopped by and I asked her about her work life, and when she told us that she is in the Oberoi management program our conversation became very interesting.

  We read the reviews before booking this hotel and all I can say is that the amazing comments are justified. The hotel staff are very welcoming and helpful which must be difficult as many guests only stay for 1 or 2 nights so turnover is high. The setting of the gardens and pools are stunning and of course there is the incredible backdrop of the Taj Mahal - enough said. We relaxed a couple of days by the pool and enjoyed the hospitality after sightseeing of the Taj and other local sights. Our room was deluxe category, overlooking the Taj Mahal and with a small balcony - it was well appointed and well maintained. The hotel restaurants were also good and we were impressed by the staff who did not charge us for our whole meal when we had over ordered and left a lot of our feast. A

  This was our first stay at an Oberoi hotel, and I chose it for its proximity to the Taj Mahal.  Before arriving, I had been a little put off by the glitz factor (fleet of Audis, etc.) because I tend to prefer historic properties with more charm and the ""aura"" of history.  Still, I was eager to see the spectacular entry fountain and the pool.  Traveling as a family of 4, with two teenage daughters, I had requested two interconnecting rooms.  Upon arrival, we were informed we had been upgraded to the suite on the top floor at northeast corner of the building.  The arrival experience was already over the top, with the welcome on the balcony with the view of the Taj.  But when they showed us the suite we were quite literally stunned.  It was magnificent.

The welcome by the beautifully outfitted staff, the cold towel and welcome drink, the beautiful grounds and hotel…… Wait did I mention the view of the Taj Mahal from our (and every ) room?  (Ours was a Deluxe room for 2). The staff is amazing and the butler service spectacular (although we did not use this very often, when we called the response was immediate and efficient). The restaurants are beautiful and we enjoyed fabulous dinners in both the Bellevue and Esphahan, as well as drinks in the Bar/Lounge.  The hotel has a no tipping policy and the staff will not accept tips. Rather, on checkout you can add a global tip to your bill or put cash in an envelope.

From Pratchi, who gave us a warm welcome and introduction to the property, to Hitesh, the manager of the restaurant, who “bent over backwards” to fulfill our wishes and desires.

  Let me start this review by saying that the Amarvilas is an absolutely beautiful location with one of the most spectacular views in the world.  The complaints from other uses regarding the lower floors are overstated, as I stayed in a first floor room and had a perfectly decent view of the Taj Mahal.  Were it not for the completely unacceptable behavior of the staff, this would have been a five star review.    Secondly, all of the chauffeur staff I encountered (Ajay from Delhi and Suresh from Agra) were outstandingly polite, professional and accommodating.  They deserve five stars and my overall rating has nothing to do with their exemplary service.  Third, the restaurant and room service were outstanding, as was the staff in the restaurant.

Slightly bedraggled, our large party walked to the imposing gate. The guards immediately asked if we were visiting for lunch and ushered us in. Once inside, you are transported. The grounds are lush and manicured. The perfectly trimmed tree line eliminates the bustle of the busy city and perfectly frames the Taj Mahal among the trees. Even though they didn't have a table immediately available, we waited 15 minutes in the outdoor bar terrace and ordered drinks. From what I could see, the pool is beautifully tiled with indigo tiles and Mughal decorations. The toilets were immaculate. Attentive service at every corner.

  First class hotel that perhaps, to be super critical, reflects the one quite transient nature of its clientele. We were there for two nights and were lucky enough to get an upgrade to a verandah room.

In keeping with some of the other places we stayed in, the air con doesn't really run to hot air but the hotel was very obliging and provided an oil filled electric heater. The restaurants are a small let down. I would concentrate on Isfahan and give the general cuisine one a miss. Please do not forget that curry is a British word import. Indian food is not curry.

This is a stunning hotel with food , service and accommodation faultless. The only place to stay in Agra and worth pushing the boat out for once. Taj Mahal far more impressive than we'd imagined. One of our best experiences ever.

  Amazing place, the pool is epic, the tour guides and the private golf cart access to the Taj Mahal with priority access, the Indian restaurant and the western restaurant were all 6 star !! The concierge service was awesome and the room was perfect. I had a suite with a balcony overlooking the Taj Mahal. It was worth the extra $$. A lot of people were having private dinners on their balconies watching the sunset. A special shout out to the driver who drove me in the hotel Audi 4x4 to Jaipur for the next part of my tour.

  We stayed at the Amarvilas as part of a two week India trip that included many Oberoi properties. To begin, the welcome was exceptional. We were greeted by 6 people with garlands and welcome drinks. We were taken out to the balcony for our first view of the Taj Majal. Spectacular! Our upgraded balcony room overlooked the beautiful pool. What really impressed us, though, was the response of the manager, Prachi Sati, to any proble,s we encountered. She read our guest survey and immediately remedied any problems or suggestions, even going so far as to bring afternoon tea to our balcony. Thank you, also, to Kushraga who attended to our every need and brought us beautiful Indian ornaments. The property really lives up to its reputation for beauty and service.

  The Oberoi Amarvilas is the most splendid establishment in Agra, bar-none. Impeccable service and staff, magnificent grounds and unparalleled views of the Taj Mahal. We could not have been more delighted with our stay here. We are especially thankful to Ms. Prachi Sati, the Rooms Division Manager, who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure that our stay was perfect. From the welcome drinks, to our 5-star dinner at Esphahan, and to our magnificent views of the Taj, the The Oberoi Amarvilas made our stay in Agra one which we will never forget.

  The hotel is extraordinary.  It looks like one of the castles in the area.  The service is better than in most five star hotels and the experience, with views of Taj Majal from all rooms at the hotel, is magical.  The food is great morning, noon and night.  There is traditional music much of the time.  The attention to detail is in everything from the fixtures, the outfits for the staff, the presentation of the food, the roses in the bath that they draw for you at turndown time, and the list goes on.  The chef explained what we were eating, the servers were personable and knowledgeable.  We enjoyed ourselves very much.  Also, you are so close to the Taj Majal, that it is easy to be the first ones in line before 6:00 am, which is what we did so as to avoid the crowds.  The hotel

The first thing is we were constantly asked as to why we were going to be there. Though apprehensive we disclosed to the hotel that we are coming to see Agra and be at the hotel as a Birthday Gift to my family member. The hotel did not attempt to do anything special on the first or second day. On 19th October 2018 when we had dinned in the restaurant we were asked why were we visiting.

The incredible views of the Taj Mahal from every room, the balconies, the bar, and the lounge are such that I took pictures repeatedly, just to get every angle and every type of light. The hotel is somewhat modeled after this World Heritage site in that the fountains in the front shoot water into large pools—which is understandably and sadly missing from the tourist spots because water is in short supply these days.

The coaches are a little worn but they’re clean and the aircon works well, perhaps a little too well so take a cardigan! A gentleman comes round with soft drinks and nibbles.

The resorts grounds are just fantastic and we wished we had more time and better weather to fully enjoy the hotel.  Would highly recommend staying here for any visit to Agra.

The room was luxurious, the food was fabulous and the service was absolutely wonderful. The Taj is quite the most beautiful building we have seen and visiting it was an experience we will never forget. Thanks to Luxury Escapes for organising our trip to India, it was a magnificent experience and incredible value.

  Stayed 2 nights. Hotel so relaxing with spa pool garden and views. When I travel the hotel is usually just a place to sleep. This property makes you forget your in Agra. You are tempted to cancel all tours and just sit on Your balcony or at the pool and take in the view.   The bar and restaurant are excellent and reasonably priced.   Although amazing. It does seem overpriced. Little things can be improved. Hair dryers are old. Espresso machine did not work. There were other minor service flaws such as unwanted noise that were surprising for a room in India.    You are paying for the view. And it is really one of the best views.

  The rooms at this hotel all have a view of the Taj Mahal. We were upgraded to a balcony room and I would recommend this as it gives you more opportunity to enjoy the view. The hotel is so luxurious with the pool area the most beautiful I have seen. The rooms also look over the pool area. The staff were welcoming and helpful with good local advice. The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays so they recommended a tour early on Saturday which worked well for us. The hotel is very close ( walking distance) to the Taj and although I had read that there wasn’t much else to see in Agra I would disagree ! I think there is plenty to see in Agra!

  We stayed in Agra with our 2 Kids (1 and 3 years old) and had an amazing time at the Oberoi Amarvillas. Simply entering the lobby and seeing Taj Mahal through the windows was magic. The staff was amazing, the service stuff even put 2 teddy bear with the names of our little ones on our beds after servicing the room. The views from the room terrace on level 4 breathtaking, the food excellent. We booked a Taj Mahal tour through the hotel and everything was perfect, they bought the tickets, had the gold cart ready to bring us to the entrance and picked us up just 2 minutes after leaving the Taj Mahal. This is the best way to experience the Taj Mahal with young kids. I arrange a terrace dinner and this was magical as well.

The rest of the experience was a little short of what we experienced in the other Oberois: perhaps they're relying too much on their fabulous location, right next to the Taj Mahal, for the only wow factor.  The staff were polite but disinterested; not at all like the other Oberois where the staff fell over themselves to make you feel welcome.

We were surprised with an upgrade to a balcony room where one can sit and enjoy the amazing sight before you. The rooms are a bit dated compared to the previous Oberoi hotels, but it makes up for it with the views and the beautiful grounds.   In terms of the service, it is a shade behind Rajvilas despite the big welcome given when you first arrives. The waiters/waitress at their 2 restaurants were wonderful, but in terms of that special touch with the guests, they are a step behind Rajvilas.

We had again the room with balcony and view of Taj. Swimming pool is huge and almost empty all the time so we felt like having pool just for ourselves.

The Approach ( Driving Down): The entrance of hotel is towards the east gate of Taj ( It is 600m or so). The approach road gets you from ring road to a 60 ft road and a nondescript Y fork. The signage is there so take the right arm of the fork. Then its more like a cobbled road with immense traffic and parking for regular buses.

  An Indian Palace that overlooks the Taj Mahal, with absolute excellence in hospitality.. Everything about the Oberoi Amarvilas was exceptional from every member of staff to the room that has everything you could possibly desire. And if there is something you can think you need, they will make it magically appear. The dining too is exceptional with every choice to suit every palate. Thank you Oberoi for a magical stay in your beautiful hotel.

  Wow. What a property by the Oberoi group of hotel. Lavish hotel. On a business trip to Agra travelling with family. Trying to manage work and family simultaneously. Hotel is excellent and is a class apart from other hotels in Agra that's why one can see the tariff difference from other hotels and get what you pay for. Taj Mahal view from the rooms and swimming pool with clean treated water to relax. Great property.

  Celebrated my birthday in Oberoi Amavilas, one of the best hotel in the world.  Hotels around the world should learn from this hotel the true definition of hospitality, staff with attention to details, service with a smile and you can really feel the service from their heart and how passionate they are. Such a positive feeling with a warm welcome special mention to Ms. Prachi who gave us the best gift, we love it. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Agra. The hotel is few steps away from Taj Mahal East entrance, best location.

  We stayed as a family of 3 for two nights in August in a double premier room with balcony.  We also organised to renew our wedding vows with a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony, this was a magical experience and probably the highlight of our trip overall to India.  The hotel is stunning, rooms are very well appointed and the two onsite restaurants are lovely fitted out, great  decor and fabulous food, we even had a tour of the kitchen on our first evening. The pool area is also stunning and of course what better view than the Taj Mahal in the background. We had a very slight hiccup with communications for a balcony dinner, but nothing major and overall would highly recommend the hotel, it manages to have scale, ambiance and luxury whilst feeling homely with everyone knowing

  Oberoi AMARVILAS is such amazing accommodation to undertake...the view is just mesmerizing...to wake up in the morning looking out at the Taj Mahal, your butler has just delivered your masala tea with gorgeous cake in tea pot with tea cups is living the dream. The service was above and beyond...we ordered local breakfast for the 2 days of our stay which consisted of the best dhal with chutney, pickle, yoghurt, cauliflower and potato dosi and garlic nann bread, the best we have ever eaten, compliments to the cheff were given. After having breakfast, we wondered if the Dinner would be as rewarding, we shouldn't off as eating at the Esphahan was outstanding. The hotel is so worth the money as the level of service and the hotel itself is something you have to experience as it is

  After experiencing my stay at amar villas I can tell you this property will be my reason to revisit the Great Taj mahal. Since I was not aware about the history of the property so on my arrival at the property I assumed that this would have been a very luxurious palace converted to a hotel. The true detailing and experience that actually mesmerizes all your 5 senses can't be captured in couple of pictures or in a review. You have to be there to feel it.  Pros 1. Lush green landscape with exotic flora and fauna 2. Fantastic architecture relevant to the region  3. Royal entrance unlike a modern hotel with a porch opening up in the lobby. Here there is a massive stone darvaza(gate) that opens up in a very big courtyard and garden with countless fountains  4. spacious rooms with
 </>
 < class=""_1M-1YYJt"">
  modern amenities and detailed interiors  5. All the rooms are taj facing and along with that the view of the hotel is nothing less than taj 6. Extra ordinarily warm and friendly staff. Special thanks to Mr pathak(gm), prache(room manager),shashank(restaurant manager), chef saurabh for ensuring that our experience was memorable 7. Dinner under the stars is a must to do at amar villas in my opinion(you will not regret it) 8. Excellent food and customising it is totally possible   Cons  There are ups and downs in all the property but what matters is that how well the hotel makes it up to you once you have informed them about it and these guys will leave no stones unturned.

  We visited Amarvillas Agra with our family in the month of January 2021. Coming from the hectic work schedule in Delhi, it was one of the best holidays for us. Starting from the moment we entered Amar villas until the day we left from the property each moment was an experience we shall never forget. The Hospitality was unmatched and each member of the staff personally took such good care of us and our kids that it felt like we are their family and it’s our home. Mr Vishal Pathak, the GM, was kind enough to take out time to meet us and take our feedback many times during our stay. Mr Deep, Mr Harshid , Mr Akash and each person we came in contact with, touched our heart. It was an experience beyond our expectations. They did not leave anything undone whether it was the surprise

  The exteriors of the Amarvilas are just stunning, an architectural feat almost, with perfectly manicured lawns, greenery, shrubs pruned to perfection and gorgeous landscaping! The way the local sandstone has been used to weave their outdoors is mindblowing.  The views the Taj from the room balconies is unbelievable! I mean where in the world can you get that, looking at te wonder of the world while sipping your tea/cofffee!  The staff and service is 10/10, and really cannot get more co-operative or courteous. I will have to say I travel a fair bit, and ave stayed at some top properties, but the service at Amarvilas surpasses any other absolutely. To give an example, breakfast is supposed to be upto 10.30am, but they served us in the room till 11-30-12pm! Without any hesitation

  The Oberoi Amarvilas was the most impressive place we stayed during our two weeks holiday in India. The location is stunning, our room was on the third floor with the large balcony which had a great view of the Taj Mahal. All the staff were friendly and helpful, especially the staff who served us at Esphahan. The food served at Esphahan was great with high quality, we loved the old delhi butter chicken which we called it the “best butter chicken ever”. The attention to detail was superb. If you have the worry about a long day road trip, hard to find quality food outside of the hotel, meal boxes were provided in the breakfast restaurant for all the guests to take extra free food to eat on the road. It is a hotel that is loved by travelers, highly recommend the Oberoi Amarvilas

  Since my engagement, my husband (then fiance) wanted to make me stay at The Oberoi as each and every room has a view of the Taj (the symbol of eternal love). I saw the pictures and immediately agreed for Amar Vilas to be the start to our moons.  We were at the property for just 1 night - from 19th to 20th of Dec, 2020.   Our stay was nothing short of excellent. We were greeted at the entrance and from then on, we had people serving, helping, guiding us throughout our stay. The food was exceptional. Being a luxury property and having a lot of foreigners as their guests, we had assumed the food to be bland but it was just outstanding - breakfast, lunch as well as the dinner. The staff arranged a special balcony dinner for us as it was our honeymoon. There was a personal butler who

But everything else was not good. Food was not at all tasty . Rooms were clean but wooden flooring was dirty .All working staff seemed to be young and no experienced person was there! Very less range of menu, poor presentation specially Curd which was sour, South Indian was really bad! On complaints , they offered to replace but of no use!
