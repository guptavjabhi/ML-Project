  I visited the hotel in February for 2 nights, we were a family of 7. From the start the service was impeccable. It was my father I  laws birthday and when I requested for an upgrade for them, the room was allocated. The staff, specially OM ji at dining and Vinay ji at reception were extremely courteous and eager to serve. It's a well maintained and beautiful property. One of the best in Agra. There are huge  lawns which can be used by family. Overall , we had a good time. Due to covid, there are no engagement activities and almost all facilities are closed down. Apart from that ,everything was par excellence.

  We stayed for two nights three days at the ITC Mughal, Agra . We were two families and we enjoyed our stay a lot. As a Marriott platinum member, we got an upgrade and we signed into the MAP plan to enjoy the much heard about delicacies of ITC , especially avoiding the city food amid the pandemic. The service was class and the crew excellent. Special thanks to Ankit, the front office manager, Omveer, Taj Maykhana Club and Anwar in Taj Bano. The food was excellent, keep up the good work guys.  Cheers  Puneet Chopra

The property is amazing right from the time we enter the property. There are many landscaped gardens all throughout the hotel. We basked in the sun and strolled around. The food was good but the dining areas were a bit too crowded. Some managing of dining areas need to be improved. Special thanks to Anwar and Vikrant in the Dining restaurant.

  It's a bliss when you have such a wonderful holiday,the one which we had from the 27th Jan 2021 till today. The ambience of the hotel ,literally  took our breath away. The plush green lawns,immaculate flower beds, and to top it we got upgraded. The main apprehension was about food, being Celiac patient.  Utter caution has to be taken . Very strict dietary regime to be followed. But, wow, the Chef, Kavita, really took care. When she was not there, Sumit, carried the baton. Kudos to them, both. In the front office ,Vishwas Kapoor, was very very helpful. The dining room staff, Bicky and his team ,do also deserve praise for in the way they served us, with so much love. If you have any food allergies, this is the right place to go,if not, the more so the reason to go. Had a meeting

  The stay at the hotel was comfortable and relaxing. Mention to front desk personnel Mr. Rajat Verma for keeping up the hospitality demands. Mr. ManSingh for prompt room service and Mr. Dinesh Rajput, the baggage butler for our room.  A few improvements i would like to see as well. The food serving staff across the counter must have knowledge about what he/she is serving. Secondly, the senior staff at the dining area should be polite in their words and actions. Call was not answered for long durations made to the hotel staff.  So, overall a comfortable stay but with lots of improvements.

  So it was a long pending trip. I was supposed to get my grandmother to Agra few months back but due to Covid 19 I did not get the opportunity. I finally took a weekend to show her Taj and booked a room in ITC Mughal. Mr Sanjoo at the front desk was really helpful and he even upgraded our room to a suite which was really kind of him. He made sure me and my grandmother were comfortable throughout our stay and even helped us with our visit to Taj. The dinner at Pavilion was very good but the only drawback was the breakfast. The breakfast was not up to the mark and can be improved. Overall we had an amazing stay and we will forever remember this short trip to Taj.

  So the hotel at very perfect location. Me and my wife visited there just couple of days before.Eveeything is awesome there. Like ambience, staffs behaviour, rooms and environment, all were perfect. Just one thing because of which I could not give you a 5 star that is food. Food were good in taste however somthing was missing. And the missing thing is concept. I mean to say the person or a team who basically decide the menu should understand that you have eveey class of people. Like in dinner there were no normal rice only fried rice and biryani kind of things were available, secondary if you are listing biryani in your menu, you should understand that not all the people eats mutton so should be chciken biryani as well. There were a chicken curry kind of an item as well in dinner

  Hello all. Firstly, i know that you are reading this to get to my review of ITC Mughal but apologies for kicking my review off with my personal experience on this entire visit. During this pandemic, we all have been scared to move out and have been deferring all the travel itineraries to future periods. However with my 5th wedding anniverasry coming in Jan, i took the plunge of booking the best hotel in Agra, ITC Mughal and got it at a decent package for breakfast and dinner. I was travelling with my mother, wife (ofcourse) and an infant. The day I had to leave for Agra, we were surprised by the morning fog and were thinking of cancelling the visit. But took the risk and drove for 5 hours - cautious and slow to reach our destination. On reaching the hotel, i was surprised to see

  ITC is definitely a name we can trust for luxurious properties, well maintained surroundings, polite/smiling staff and relaxing rooms. During my stay I was very impressed with how they are able to maintain such a big property in terms of cleanliness. I could not spot a point that has been left unattended for a while and getting dusty.  The staff is very humble and helpful.  Dinner at Peshawari which comprised of the famous Dal Bukhara with Pudina parantha made the stay successful.  Great effort by ITC team. Thanks  Looking forward to explore other luxury collections by ITC.

  An excellent luxurious hotel, located close to Taj Mahal, where one can see the monument on a clear day from the hotel itself. Beautiful garden and interiors, however the fountains were not fully functional, maybe due to COVID. The Check in is contactless but little cumbersome. The rooms are spacious with all requisite features. Staff is welcoming and professional. The Breakfast and Dinner buffet at Taj Bano is fine, however, more variety can be added and the taste is more for the foreign tourists as it is very less spicy. The hotel is observing all COVID prcautions. Would definitely visit again!

  This was our first vacation in 10 months and we mostly wanted to be indoors on the hotel property. So a 32 acre property with 750 Sq ft of room space was definitely appealing. We arrived on 1 January and the hotel was buzzing with activity. The restaurant was full of revellers and so was the lobby. The courteous staff helped us checkin and sort the confusion with MakeMyTrip seamlessly. The hotel manager was my favourite as he was so accommodating to give our  3 suites together on the same floor. And then the cherry on the cake was that he upgraded us to THE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. While the hotel is great, the staff there are what makes the place so endearing. The lounge access and happy hours that comes complimentary with the suite was our favourite family time. Kiddies were

The rooms are beautifully done up.We had taken an all meal package and had a buffet at the coffee shop for all 3 meals each day.It was a good spread considering the occupancy was low.The staff from all departments be it housekeeping,front desk or the restaurants/lounge...they go above n beyond to ensure a happy customer.Unfortunately there is no alcohol beimg served in the hotel but there is a wine shop right across which is convenient.All in all a very good break for us

  I was there for a wedding, and couldn't say that I can find a better place to stay and explore hospitality. ITC truly brings colors of hospitality by making their guest feel ""at home"" at all levels. Being busy in the function couldn't get much of chances to interact with people serving you around but with whom so ever I interacted were amazing, polite and kind enough to help you in every possible manner. Check in was smooth credit goes to Hemendra and Ajay. Check out was quick and hassle free because of Rajat and Mohita. Baggage was handled like professionals by Jabbar and Charuti. I will surely visit again for a longer duration to experience ITC charm.

  The red brick building surrounded by sprawling gardens with fountains and lots of green area spread across 23 acres of land gives the feel of living in a Mughal fort or a palatial complex.  The basic category rooms (The Tansen Suits in Jahangir Mahal area) are not very big, and have a very basic but neat bathrooms. We did find the shower area a bit too narrow. And there was very less space in the closed/dressing area to keep your luggage. But if you want to enjoy real luxury, and can afford it, we recommend their Grand Presidential Suit, which has a bigger room, a lobby area, a personalised spa room where two people can receive a private massage, a personal sauna and a private swimming pool.

  We visited ITC Mughal as a family for 2 nights. From check in to check out, every experience was seamless and the staff was extremely warm and welcoming. The property is beautiful, well maintained and well located. All services - room, cleaning, salon, front desk, restaurants - were exceptional. The hotel has taken all measures and precautions in light of covid 19 as well. We felt safe being here.  Shout out to Ajay, Shankar ji, Omveer ji and Bhim ji. They provided exceptional service and took great care of us. We highly recommend this property and would love to stay here again.

Mr.Omveer,the restaurant manager,went out of his way to make the the stay comfortable and ensured that all our needs were met.An extremely courteous gentleman I must say.The head chef Kavita and Priya at the front desk were extremely co operative and as always,ITC seemed just the right choice. Except for some glitches in house keeping,the rest of the things were amazing. The dining experience was super great. Highly recommended.Just go there,unwind and make memories, and they would take care of the rest.

I would really like to appreciate the staff for their hospitality , we all dined at Taj Bano Restaurant. It was a marvellous experience. Basic aspects of hospitality, there is nothing which we din feel. So much of warmth, politeness and positive attitude of the staff, it was incredible. I would really want to put down names of Chef Kavita, Chef Sumit, Ankush, Bhim Ji and Kishan Ji, you guys rock.   Welcoming a guest and taking care of their needs, one should actually learn from you guys. It was indeed a wonderful experience for 3 of us to cherish always and I will see you guys soon again.

  Mughal is a very authentic hotel and the staff have been well trained and are extremely responsive to its guests. I would not hesitate to book here again whenever I came to Agra and would recommend this establishment without reservation to anyone desiring to stay in a hotel with more than a touch of class. It would be remiss of me not to give a special thanks to Mr. Sanjoo and who was of particular assistance when my wife and I were desperate to get some last minute computer assistance before leaving and Mr. Vinay for a smooth departure. If I had one complaint about the hotel it would have to be that we only stayed one night. It is a pity that the hotel did not warn us that we would have enjoyed our stay so much!!!!!

And the greenery and expanse of the property was to die for. Due to the pandemic, we were weary of going to major tourist attractions and the property gave us all the reasons to stay in. The vast gardens, locomotive park, fountain areas and pools made our stay memorable. The hotel is also located very close to great rooftop restaurants if you‚Äôre looking for a taste of the local cuisine at a more affordable rate.

  This was the first travel during the pandemic, and we selected ITC for the brand it is.  1. I was taken aback by the best practices they followed for sanitization - all rooms were 'cleansed' beforehand, and the entire property was sprayed in front of us. 2. Our check-in was a breeze 3. The rooms were exactly as in the pictures and were over the top luxurious yet comfortable. 4. The breakfast spread was lavish and tasty. 5. The people at the reception, were helpful and made sure we have a relaxing vacay. Rajat, the floor-manager, helped us with everything from getting us in, to get all the COVID-19 paperwork, to informing us about the whereabouts. Thanks man. 6. The property itself is pretty. Elegance and modern, with a royal theme.   Would definitely come again.

We had been looking for a place where Hygiene wouldn't be a concern and hence we decided to stay at ITC Mughal.  The resort is absolutely beautiful and vast. Location wise its perfect as it is only around 3 kms from the Taj Mahal. In fact, you can get Taj's partial view from the resort itself.  We checked-In at around 12 Noon and were promptly shown to our room. At the reception desk, Mohita was warm and courteous. However, its the duty manager Rajat who just stole the show with his warm welcome and genuine smile.   Due to the COVID precautions, few amenities were not present in the room however, they were available on request. But I must admit due to their absence, the

I had told the lady at the reception that a few friends would come to help me get ready and we would leave by evening time, and after the wedding I'll be back around 11pm with my wife. I had requested that you guys please clean the room once, and the lady said they'll place a small cake in the fridge. To my extreme disappointment, I came back around midnight to find the room not cleaned, in the exact same state that I left it, and no cake or anything.   The room itself, the food and everything else was good enough, but what happened spoiled the entire experience.

Firstly their Entrance COVID protocol was not that great or strict (they missed taking temp of my wife).   The room located at basement had a damp smell and our phone had no network there. On trying to call the reception there was no number specified anywhere and the operator put us on hold forever to get through them, still Without any positive response.

Food otherwise  was good, but could have been better considering its ITC and known for food.  Anwar at the restaurant, and a Restaurant manager (female) I really do apologize I don't remember her name (please do check who was on duty on the said dates)  were great  , very courteous, always helpful and serving .   Only Negatives -  I believe because of Covid you have hired temporary staff. They were not ITC standards specially at the restaurant , and infact quite

  My Stay at IC Mughal, Agra  First opinion. According to me this cannot come under a Luxury collection. I have stayed in almost all properties of ITC. The Grand Chola, Kohinoor, Bengal and Grand Bharat is in my bucket list.   When you compare the other properties, you cannot call the ITC Mughal a Luxury collection. For me this property cannot be more than a 3 or a 4-star category.   When you get into a luxury collection, the staff out there make you feel that you have entered a luxury property which was totally missing in the Mughal, Agra. Probably this is not a business property. The other property is once a customer always a customer due business reasons. However, in Agra, you may not come back again and again as its mainly a tourist spot and not a business spot. Due to this

  Stayed in the beautiful property of ITC Mughal from 2-4th October. Faced some initial issues during check-in process, but they were made up for by upgrading the rooms, sending delicious birthday cakes,  accepting late check-out request and the great hospitality shown throughout the stay. Kids loved the huge green property, the pools though were closed (due to COVID). Overall stay was excellent, will return back for sure.  Will like you to please add on - cleaning of in-house guest cars (atleast the front glass windshield), specially during CHECK-OUT. Due to excessive bird droppings, it becomes very difficult to drive back home safely.  Thanks &amp; Regards Dr Ishan Gupta Consultant, Dr. LalPathLabs Ltd.

  We planned a quick dash from Delhi to Agra and knowing we will be spending time inside the hotel only chose ITC Mughal @ Tajganj. And what an experience it was. We found the perfect Ambassador in Rajat Verma @the front office. He made the stay memorable and infact my wife often says if we have nothing to do let's take a dash to ITC Mughal again. Rajat has helped us explore many other group properties as well for wife's 50th and that really stands out. The property is amazing - a quiet pool of serenity with ample space for yourself, resplendent luxury and some hidden gems like the beautiful terrace to see the Taj @sunset and sunrise. The lush lawns and the pool are perfect for a walk within the premises. Which is mandatory to get over the guilt of the delicious food you get. The

  We stayed in ITC Mughal from 6th to 8th September 2020. I think they were still not prepared to cater guests as they opened on 1st Sept only. The AC was always high and even inside our room we were not able to get a comfortable temperature. Even after multiple complaints no improvement was done. Second disappointment was dinner. I still regret that why we included dinner in our package.They said they had a fixed menu thali even Rajathani thali in delhi is much better than that.  Third disappointment was the supplies were still from pre lockdown era. All water bottles and tea/milk powder were having before march date of manufacture . Forth disappointment was less of covid rules were getting followed. No hand santisation at the entrance.  Less social distancing in the restaurant.

  Magnificent   one of the nicest hotels we've ever been in. Service was outstanding, room was amazing, dining (both buffet and Peshawari) were brilliant; lobby and common areas were spotlessly clean. We had a room with a large - HUGE - pillow on the floor, on which we lay and read and looked out over the fountains and garden. Staff seemed to go out of their way to look for ways to help us out, offering suggestions and ideas. At the end Taj Mahal View from the viewpoint added a bouns in it.

  We were 3 families visiting the Mughal for first time ever. We prefer Taj all over but was glad to choose Mughal this time.   The welcome staff at reception was nice, specially Priya who assisted us for check-in and gave us a suite also.  The bar in lobby is a cherry on cake,perfect place for evening. We even went to the Taj view point, worth to see from there.  I felt the hotel needs some renovation now.

  Stunning reception area, the bedrooms were fine, but nothing too special, the outdoor area including the pool was rather tatty. The pool in all the photos is only available for people staying in the suites - not what I would expect!  The food was OK, but some of the staff didn't seem very motivated. I guess most of the guests were on a 1 or 2 day trip to visit the nearby Taj Mahal - which certainly didn't disappoint!  We went on to stay at the ITC in Goa, which was in very different league.

  Despite arriving just before Coronavirus reached India in any significant way, we were generously upgraded to a Murghal Suite which was very well appointed and huge.   The hotel itself is gorgeous with beautiful gardens and a glamorous lobby attended by very friendly and enthusiastic receptionists who explained all the hotel‚Äôs facilities (this is so lacking in most hotels) including a wonderful viewing tower where one could see the Taj Mahal. Spa is magnificent but sadly we didn‚Äôt have time to use it.   Lobby bar served us a light lunch and it was much appreciated that the waiter told us not to order a Club Sandwich each as they were huge (&amp; delicious) and one between us would suffice.   Beautifully attired old school staff and a wonderful breakfast (loved our waiter, Umar).

  This place pretty much delivers in terms of its quality but, watch out for its somewhat eye-watering prices in its basement bar. Expensive by any standard.

  We had booked four rooms for 1 night but due to some emergency had to forego two rooms and I really appreciated that the property allowed us to convert the booking into two rooms for two nights and also gave a super nice upgrade. The property seems rather ordinary from the outside but is spacious and beautiful inside. They have two outdoor pools (of which one is reserved for a section of the rooms one of which was occupied by us among others and seemed more private and nice). They also have a huge lawn at the back besides kids play areas with ropeway/slides etc and ample indoor games and a small labyrinthe garden for kids to enjoy. The car parking is also very spacious. Locationwise too it is a great property. Not too far from Taj (about 10 minutes drive to the Taj parking spot)

  This is truly a beautiful hotel with stunning rooms and good restaurant,but it‚Äôs seems to miss some of the finer points like the bathroom condiments. ( there there,but sparse)There is a roof top viewing area with distant views of the Taj Mahal, but strangely it‚Äôs locked and you need to have someone come and unlock the door then they wait till you take some photos and then re-lock the door again. The internet is average and slow. Don‚Äôt get me wrong , anyone would enjoy there stay here, I just think that they could do better on the little things.

Peshwari restaurant I'm sorry to say was a big disappointment.  Just not worth it and not that friendly.  The hotels main buffet restaurant was much better with excellent choices, again to suit all tastes and lovely staff.

  Stayed in March 2020, the property is old and we booked Mughal Chambers, newly renovated. However there were certain issues in our first day of stay and the next morning we met Mr. Rajat Verma, duty manager. He made sure that he turned around our experience and provided us with the best of amenities for our remaining stay at the hotel. It is people like him who are an asset to have in the hospitality space, he understood our concerns and resolved them promptly.Having travelled extensively across hotels in the world, one thing that i have seen which changes bad to good &amp; good experiences to great is the staff and service. Kudos to ITC Mughal for the team and thanks to Mr. Rajat for providing us with a great experience.

  The ITC Mughal, which is a Marriott property for you rewards members, is a top-notch hotel. The property was very clean, as was the room and the restaurants/bars. After a day of touring the Taj, this place was a great spot to decompress from the day. The staff, from check-in to the bar, were all very pleasant. Especially of note, the Asst. Manager Front Desk, Jayant Rana, was a huge help. my wife and I probably didn't do the best job planning our trip back to Delhi, and Jayant was a huge help in talking with a local driver to help us get on our way. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in the Agra area.

Apart from the property itself which is a sprawling resort ( with manicured gardens, golf course and tennis courts) it was the personal touch of the team which made the difference. The housekeeping team was silently behind the scenes whilst being clinically efficient whilst the F&amp;B team turned out exotic offerings from the fabled ITC cuisine in Peshawari and Mughal Bano. Though I could  not use the world class SPA, I was provided a  detailed tour and on my next visit would love to experience it....

One thing I would maybe recommend is to guide the guest to their rooms as we had a hard time finding our rooms as this is a very large hotel.    Rooms- the suite looked like it was recently updated, the other room was also an updated room.  However the room and washrooms didn't look like they were cleaned properly.  There was lot of dust and overall didn't feel like a very clean room.  Restaurant- the restaurant downstairs was decent, we had the dinner buffet.  Food

  We had a wonderful experience at this hotel ‚Äî even though the rooms are dated and the overall maintenance could be improved. It‚Äôs a very comfortable hotel near the Taj Mahal. Lobby and entrance is large and inviting and the breakfast is good as any high-end buffets. Took a bath and while yes, the bathroom can smell slightly, I personally loved the old charm and history yet remnant in the room overall.   The photos make the hotel look newer and cleaner than it really is though. And the front desk quoted us the wrong price for international calls then took forever to update the charge on our bill.

  We were there from 13th feb for 3 nights as it was my Mother In Law's 76th Birthday. I am a Taj loyalist but my friend Samir Jilani, who is RM at ITC Delhi suggested me to try ITC. It was the 1st ever ITC hotel i stayed at. Right from checking in to checking out, everything was perfect. Mr Dennis made sure that the menu for High Tea &amp; the surprise birthday party on the 13th was super good. He even arranged for live music. Compliments to Chef Kavitha for the food right from Breakfast till dinner. Mr Raj, our butler, never left us alone. Was always there at our beck &amp; call. Even Mr Ram Naresh made sure the rooms were spick &amp; . My mother turns 75 in july so am already thinking of ITC Manesar. Well done team ITC Mughal.

  Our second visit to Agra and unsurprisingly we also returned to the ITC Mughal. Apart from the amenities one would expect the service is most personal and attentive. One person who left a lasting memory and who is much the same today as on our last visit was P.Mohan in the Taj Bano restaurant. His big smile and appetite for making sure one doesn‚Äôt miss out on anything is infectious and makes us want to return again.

  This was our second ITC experience after some hiccups in Jaipur.  Check in was well managed, the hotel is sprawling and lovely.  The service and lighting in the Taj Bano all day dining restaurant was superior to their property in Jaipur.  I suggested to all our hotels to put translations on the indian items explaining the items in English. To non hindi speakers seeing a sign like Baigan Bharta means nothing.  They need to know it is eggplant etc.  ( We had this experience at ITC and non-ITC properties),  We had a very brief one night visit.   The rooms are lovely, modern feeling.  Bathrooms are large.

We found the service in the restaurants to be a bit slow and lacking esp since we were dining with younger children. This was a change from the other hotels in which we stayed during our trip to India.  There was also a loud party at 4 AM on a Monday night on the floor above us. Called the front desk which helped to settle down the noise for 30 minutes, but then they

  The hotel is absolutely gorgeous, and very comfortable. Extremely lavish. The front office team gave us a warm welcome. Thankyou so much to Ankit sir and Jayant. The newly renovated Mughal chambers add a modern look to an otherwise antique hotel which is based on the Mughal dynasty as the name suggests. The hotel has an unusual feature - an observation deck which allows a reasonable view of the Taj Mahal across the rooftops, in the distance. It was quite spectacular at dusk. The food was marvellous and mouth watering at peshawri. We were celebrating my dad‚Äôs birthday and the staff was courteous enough to give us a complimentary cake. Overall the stay was great and the staff made it memorable for us.

  We stayed at the hotel as part of a golden triangle tour organised by Sita, through Imagine Cruising. The hotel bar, lounge, public areas and gardens are stunning. Our bedroom was pleasant but the bathroom was old, tired and grubby. The tiny shower head over the bath was disappointing and the bath plug did not fit properly causing the bath water to drain out whilst in the bath. The plug attachment also fell in to the bath and was absolutely filthy.    This was particularly annoying as we had paid extra to upgrade to 5* hotels for this special holiday. We complained to reception and were told that it would be 'fixed'. The receptionist was not interested and indeed the plug was left as it appears in the photos. Not good enough!

  This hotel has seem better days. It's nowhere near the quality one would expect from the ITC brand. Hall carpet in need of replacement, rooms and restaurants need a deep-cleaning, outside of building needs a good power-washing. Hospitable staff but they don't honor Bonvoy discounts. Took over an hour to check out after negotiating and cross checking hotel bill...strategy: make nothing easy, add small charges and require guest to negotiate for correct charges (hmm). I'd opt for Oberoi, Taj or Courtyard if I were you.

My one complaint would be the freezing temperatures in the public spaces of the hotel. Our stay was in December, and the exterior temperature was approximately 3-5 Celcius, and it was not much warmer in the hotel. No space heaters or blankets were provided.

We called the concierge service from room but no one picked up the phone after transferring us multiple times. No one made extra effort to answer our questions about Taj navigation.

  The Hotel used to be iconic, now even worse than a railway waiting room. Simple facilities are not available in the room. If one is booked through some third party agent, which in today's world a very common gate way to book hotels, ITC not just for Mughal but for all its facilities do not give credits under its loyalty membership cards by stating third party books are not recognized. While getting bookings ITC will use all third party gate ways but for benefits nothing. Further, once guest is in the hotel uses any of the facilities, which are directly charged by the Hotel even their credits are refused. It is shocking way how ITC cheats its customers.  While settling your bills, your staff has the audacity to request please give good reviews. How Hippocratic.

  The hotel is listed as a Marriott Luxury Collection hotel, but didn't live up to its hype.  The grounds was very nice and it is in close proximity to the Taj Mahal.  The check-in process was good and the lady at front desk was very cordial and pleasant.  The roroms were musty with stained carpets.  The paint in hallways was peeling and the carpets worn and coming off the floor.  The dining room with the buffett was cramped and the service poor.  It looked like either they didn't have enough wait staff or all the wait staff were work in the same area.

My daughter now wants a spa experience every month !! The Food was finger licking delicious! ITC has the best food to offer. The Peshawari restaurant has to be sampled on your visit. The breakfast has a huge variety and the service was prompt and efficient. We didn‚Äôt have to wait for hot dosas or pancakes. All in all a very warm cozy and wonderful hotel .

Although they said the tap water was filtered through reverse-osmosis, it was very oily and salty (I didn't drink the water...but tasted it as I brushed my teeth /showered). That grossed me out a bit.  Spa, however, was great and big.

  We have a choice of staying at a variety of properties, however, being that we are Bonvoy Titanium Elite, we chose this property. From check in to check out the service was exceptional. We were celebrating a birthday and anniversary and they went out of their way to make all of us feel special. We also were traveling with two children under 10 and they made every effort to keep them comfortable with food, drink and hospitality. This is a property I definitely will visit again!
